### Data Ownership ###

In the material world, the difference between the terms
possession and property is an abstract, yet necessary
construct. It is accepted that moving a good from one place to another
and changing possession of the good does not necessarily have an impact
on the property rights. Regarding the specific concept of the
International Data Spaces, it is necessary to take into account that the
Data Owner and Data Provider may not be identical (see Chapter 3.1.1).

From a legal perspective, there is no ownership regarding data, as data
is an intangible good. With the Free Flow of Data
Regulation[^1],Â the European Commission supports data exchange and data
sharing across borders in the means of technical hurdles. The IDS
approach supports the implementation of the regulation for non-personal
data. At the same time the democratization of data is not the aim of the
IDS concept, as data ownership is an important aspect when it comes to
offering data and negotiating contracts in digital business ecosystems,
especially because data can easily be duplicated.

The International Data Spaces makes sure the need of a Data Provider or
a Data Producer is comprehensively addressed by providing a secure and
trusted platform for authorization and authentication within a
decentralized architecture. This allows Data Providers as well as
Service Providers to be identified and controlled by an Identity
Provider (see Chapter 3.1.1). Decentralized data exchange by means of
Connectors, in contrast to other architectures of data networks (e.g.,
data lakes or cloud services), ensures full data sovereignty. In
addition to these self-control mechanisms, the architecture allows
logging of data transfer information at a Clearing House (see Chapter
3.2.5).

As the need for Data Sovereignty is obvious, but the term of ownership
is not defined for data, the term Data Sovereign indicates the
rights, duties, and responsibilities for this role. The term and the
role of the Data Owner is defined for this document in section 3.1.1 and
does not cover a legal statement on data ownership. This is indeed
relevant on every layer of the architecture.

As the International Data Spaces intends to build upon and apply
existing law, it will not include any purely technology-oriented
solutions to prevent data duplication or misuse of data assets. However,
it supports these important aspects over the entire data lifecycle.
Furthermore, it supports the arrangement of collaborative solutions by
providing an appropriate technical infrastructure.
