### Governance for Vocabularies ###
The need for shared vocabularies, or 'semantic standards', in data sharing networks cannot be overstated. They provide a common language for describing data, allowing different systems and organizations to share and understand the data  effectively. Without semantic standards, data is likely to be inconsistent and difficult to understand, and the added value of sharing that data decreases.

Effective governance of semantic standards is essential to achieving consistency, accuracy, and completeness in the vocabularies, as well as to keep them evolving with the changing needs of the network. This includes the creation of guidelines for creating and maintaining the standards, as well as processes for resolving conflicts or inconsistencies that may arise. 

#### Open vs. centralized governance
This last remark leads to the distinction between two types of governance: open vs. centralized. The former promotes a more democratic and participatory process, where decision about the standards are made by a broad range of stakeholders. Governance in this sense is about ensuring that the standards are inclusive and reflective of the needs of all stakeholders.

In centralized governance, the authority and responsibility for the standards are centralized and often rest with a single organization, such as a government agency or industry association. This organization has the power to create and maintain the standards, and often also to enforce them through regulations or other means. 

The centralized governance model can be more efficient in certain cases, as it allows for quicker decision-making and can be more effective in ensuring compliance. However, it can also be less flexible, and may not reflect the needs and perspectives of all stakeholders as well as the open alternative.

#### Governance goals
Whatever the approach, the goals of governance remain the same and can be summarized as: 
- ensuring reliability of the vocabulary
- ensuring quality of the vocabulary
- boost adoption of the vocabulary

##### Reliability
Ensuring the reliability of the vocabulary, i.e. its accuracy and consistency is crucial. This means ensuring that the terms and definitions used in the vocabulary are unambiguous and used consistently throughout the model. Without reliable vocabularies, there is a risk of misunderstandings and misinterpretations of data even among compliant systems, which can lead to incorrect conclusions and poor decision making.

##### Quality assurance
Additionally, governance ensures quality of the vocabulary, i.e. that it's complete, up-to-date, and relevant to the needs of stakeholders. Without quality assurance, vocabularies may be missing important terms, or may not be reflective of current needs or industry standards. To address this problem, governance organizations establish a process for quality assurance, which includes regular reviews and updates of the vocabularies, and input from stakeholders.

##### Adoption
Another important aim of governance is to boost the adoption of the vocabulary. This involves promoting the use of the vocabulary among different systems and organizations and encouraging compliance with the standards. Because of the network effect on the added value of standards, the benefits of the semantic standards will be limited without widespread adoption, and data sharing will continue to be inconsistent and costly.

To achieve this aim, vocabulary governance organizations often employ strategies for communication and education, such as providing training and resources to help stakeholders understand and use the vocabulary. Additionally, they often design incentives or rewards for organizations that adopt the vocabulary and comply with the standards, such as recognition or access to exclusive resources. Ideally, governance organizations also monitor and track the adoption of the vocabulary to identify any areas where additional support is needed, to make sure that the vocabulary is being used as intended.
