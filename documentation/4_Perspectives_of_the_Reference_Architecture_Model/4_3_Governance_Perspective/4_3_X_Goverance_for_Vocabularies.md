### Governance for Vocabularies ###

(original notes by Sebastian Steinbuss:
- shared vocabularies need a governance
- Problem description: reliability of vocabularies, quality assurance
- BOMOS Model as good practice?
- Mapping of Standards (written paper) to machine readable models leaves some  degrees of freedom
)

With regard to both 
- the large number and variety of domains covered by different vocabularies that can be used to achieve the necessary interoperability of the domains involved in use cases, and
- the nature of such vocabularies being developed, applied and managed in a shared manner,
two main perspectives need to be considered. 

These are
1. Technical level, aiming at the design of vocabularies
2. Governance level, aiming at the proper application and lifecycle of the vocabularies.
