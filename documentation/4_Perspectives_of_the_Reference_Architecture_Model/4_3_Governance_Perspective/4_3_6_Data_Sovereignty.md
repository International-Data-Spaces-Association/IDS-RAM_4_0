### Data Sovereignty ###

Data sovereignty is a natural person's or corporate entity's capability
of being entirely self-determined with regard to its data. The Reference
Architecture Model presented in this document particularly addresses
this capability, as it specifies requirements for secure data exchange
and restricted data use in a trusted business ecosystem.

The International Data Spaces promotes interoperability between all
participants based on the premise that full self-determination with
regard to one's data goods is crucial in such a business ecosystem. Data
exchange takes place by means of secured and encrypted data transfer
including authorization and authentication. The Data Provider may attach
metadata to the data transferred using the IDS Vocabulary. In doing so,
the terms and conditions to ensure data sovereignty can be defined
unambiguously (e.g., data usage, pricing information, payment
entitlement, or time of validity). The International Data Spaces thereby
supports the concrete implementation of applicable law, without
predefining conditions from a business point of view, by providing a
technical framework that can be customized to the needs of individual
participants.
