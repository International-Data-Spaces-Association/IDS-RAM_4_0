### Data Quality ###

Because of the correlation between good data quality and maximizing the
value of data as an economic good, the International Data Spaces
explicitly addresses the aspect of data quality. Due to this premise,
the International Data Spaces enables its participants to assess the
quality of data sources by means of publicly available information and
the transparency it provides with regard to the metadata brokerage functionality
it offers. Especially in competitive environments, this transparency may
force Data Providers to take data maintenance more seriously. By
extending the functionality of the Connector with self-implemented Data
Apps (see [Section 3.2.4](../../3_Layers_of_the_Reference_Architecture_Model/3_2_Functional_Layer/3_2_FunctionalLayer.md#value-adding-apps)), the International Data Spaces lays the
foundation for automated data (quality) management.
