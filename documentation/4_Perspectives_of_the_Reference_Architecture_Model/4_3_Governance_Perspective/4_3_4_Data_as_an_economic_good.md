### Data as an Economic Good

As data can be decoupled from specific hardware and software
implementations, it turns into an independent economic good. While this
opens up new opportunities, it creates challenges as well. To ensure
competitiveness of organizations, a solution is required that
facilitates new, digital business models.

The International Data Spaces offers a platform for organizations to
offer and exchange data and digital services. In doing so, it offers a
basic architecture for organizations that want to optimize their data
value chains. The main goal is to enable participants to leverage the
potential of their data within a secure and trusted business ecosystem.
The International Data Spaces thereby covers the information system
perspective and provides the components that enable participants to
define individual business cases.

The International Data Spaces neither makes any statements on legal
perspectives, nor does it restrict participants to any predefined
patterns. Instead, it offers the possibility to design digital business
models individually and as deemed appropriate.
