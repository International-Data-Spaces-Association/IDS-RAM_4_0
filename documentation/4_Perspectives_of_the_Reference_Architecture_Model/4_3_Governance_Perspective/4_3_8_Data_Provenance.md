### Data Provenance ###

By creating transparency and offering clearing functionality, the
International Data Spaces provides a way to track the provenance and
lineage of data. This is strongly linked to the topics of data ownership
and data sovereignty. Data provenance tracking can be implemented with
local tracking components integrated into IDS Connectors and a
centralized provenance storage component attached to the Clearing House
(see [Section 3.1.1](../../3_Layers_of_the_Reference_Architecture_Model/3_1_Business_Layer/3_1_1_Roles_in_the_IDS.md#clearing-house)), which receives all logs concerning activities
performed in the course of a data exchange transaction, and requests
confirmations of successful data exchange from the Data Provider and the
Data Consumer. In doing so, data provenance is always recursively
traceable. In, addition provenance information can be integrated into
the IDS Vocabulary, so as to enable the participants to maintain data
provenance as part of the metadata during the process of data exchange.

The International Data Spaces thereby provides the possibility to
implement and use appropriate concepts and standards. However, it does
not force participants to use these concepts and standards. It is
therefore up to the individual participant to provide correct
information (i.e., metadata) on the provenance of data.
