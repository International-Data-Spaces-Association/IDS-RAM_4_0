# Operational Environment Certification

[TODO: revise and add overview on different levels]

Participants in the International Data Spaces collaborate by exchanging
and sharing valuable data. For this collaboration, the IDS provides a
trusted business ecosystem. Furthermore, it is essential for the
International Data Spaces and its reputation that the participants
themselves are trustworthy. This is achieved by evaluating each
participant regarding fulfillment of defined levels of security,
including infrastructure reliability and process compliance.

To build this trust in a structured way, the International Data Spaces
has established a well-defined process for participant certification. An
in-depth description of the certification process (also with regard to
each role) can be found in Part 2 of the White Paper Certification[^4].
The participant certification criteria catalog is available for free to
all IDSA members.
