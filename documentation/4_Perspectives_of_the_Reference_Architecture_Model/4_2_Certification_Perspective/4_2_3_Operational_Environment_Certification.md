# Operational Environment Certification

Participants in the International Data Spaces collaborate by exchanging and sharing valuable data. For this collaboration, the IDS provides a trusted business ecosystem. Furthermore, it is essential for the International Data Spaces and its reputation that the participants themselves and their operational environment are trustworthy. This operational environment is the part of an organization which is responsible for the operation of an IDS component. This trustworthiness is achieved by evaluating each operational environment regarding fulfillment of defined security criteria, including infrastructure reliability and process compliance.

To build this trust in a structured way, the International Data Spaces has established the IDS Operational Environment Certification.

A central element of the IDS Operational Environment Certification are the different Trust Levels and Assurance Levels. The IDS established these levels to offer a certification which is tailormade to the different requirements and use cases in the IDS.

On one side, the following three Trust Levels are established: 
+ Trust Level 1: Entry into data sharing
+ Trust Level 2: Providing reliable services
+ Trust Level 3: Offering trust-building services

An increasing Trust Level represents an increasing number of criteria which needs to be fulfilled for a successful certification.

On the other side, the following three Assurance Levels are established:
+ Assurance Level 1: Self-Assessment
+ Assurance Level 2: External evaluation of corporate policies and processes
+ Assurance Level 3: External audit of measures controlling the adherence to corporate policies

The different Assurance Levels stand for different methods for evaluation and certification and with an increasing Assurance Level more reliable evidence for a compliance to the criteria must be presented for a successful certification.

An in-depth description of the certification process (also with regards to each role) can be found in the White Paper Certification. The White Paper is available on the IDSA homepage. The Criteria Catalogue: Operational Environment can be requested also on this IDSA homepage: [IDSA White-papers](https://internationaldataspaces.org/publications/white-papers/)
