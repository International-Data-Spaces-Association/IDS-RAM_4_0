## Preamble
Certification according to the International Data Spaces Certification Scheme (IDS-CS) is available to all organizations participating in the IDS and developers of IDS core components.
IDS-CS is a certification scheme developed by the Working Group Certification on behalf of the International Data Spaces Association.
The IDS-CS certification procedure has not yet been expressly regulated by law.
A certificate in accordance with IDS-CS may only be issued in accordance with the following Rules of Procedure.
The IDS certification is intended to enable domestic and foreign companies to have themselves certified as organizations participating in the IDS or the IDS core components implemented by them and, thus, to prove their conformity with the IDSA Reference Architecture.
Users of the IDS should be able to rely on the certification.

## 1. Scope of application    
### §1.1 Scope of application     
1. The Rules of Procedure apply to evaluations and certifications of operational environments and core components in the IDS.
2. The Operational Environment Certification serves the purpose of proving the trustworthiness of the participating organizations by evaluating the fulfillment of a number of technical and procedural requirements for the operational environment.
For the organization, the resulting certificate is the most important prerequisite for access to the IDS.
3. The Component Certification required for participating in the IDS serves the purpose of proving the trustworthiness of the developed components by evaluating the fulfillment of functional, security-relevant and procedural requirements.
The certificate is the most important prerequisite for a component being used within the IDS.

### §1.2 Subject of the evaluation and certification     
1. The certification approach for **operational environments** is represented by two dimensions:
The horizontal dimension is the evaluation depth that describes the level of detail at which the evaluation takes place (Assurance Level).
The vertical dimension is the increasing extent of the organizational security requirements to be met (Trust Level).
2. The **Core Component Certification** is interoperability and security oriented and aims at checking the development and maintenance process as well as the implementation of a component.
The Component Certification approach is represented by two dimensions:
The depth of testing during evaluation increases with each of the three defined Assurance Levels.
The three defined Trust Levels likewise increase with the security needs of the data owner or data consumer in the IDS.

### §1.3 Relationship to DIN EN ISO/IEC 17065 and 27001     
1. These Rules of Procedure are a certification program in the sense of ISO/IEC 17065.
2. The core components are products according to ISO/IEC 17065.
3. The content of the Operational Environment Certification essentially corresponds to the content of a certification of the information security management system (ISMS) according to DIN EN ISO/IEC 27001.

This applies in particular if the Certification Body, Evaluation Facilities, certifier or evaluators design, implement or offer core components or parts of core components within the last two years before or during the evaluation or certification procedure or advise providers of IDS services or agree to the future performance of such an activity with a provider of IDS services.

###  §2.8 Costs
The Certification Body and the Evaluation Facility may charge appropriate fees for their activities.
The charges shall be laid down in the contract with the Applicant.

## 3. The evaluation procedure   
### §3.1 Contractual basis      
1. The evaluation procedure is based on a contract between the Applicant and the Evaluation Facility.
2. The contract shall specify at least the following:
  * a. the evaluation item with an indication of all relevant locations;
  * b. the IDS certification criteria in the applicable version;
  * c. these procedural rules as the procedural regulation governing evaluation and certification;
  * d. the evaluation contract (scope of the evaluation, location of the evaluation, planned evaluation duration, evaluation report) including a statement of the Trust and Assurance Level applied for by the Applicant;
  * e. the Applicant\'s obligations to cooperate.

*In the case of Component Certification, the description of the evaluation item shall specify in particular which components the component comprises.*
*In the case of a Operational Environment Certification, the scope and area of application in particular must be stated.*

### §3.2 The Applicant\'s obligations to cooperate      
1. The Applicant shall carry out the cooperation activities required for proper evaluation and certification or, if applicable, those contractually agreed at his own expense.

3. The Applicant assures the Evaluation Facility and Certification Body that the measures specified in the documentation have been fully implemented.
4. Where the Applicant seeks recognition of existing certificates for his component or organization, he shall communicate the request for recognition before the start of the evaluation, specifying the exact designation of the certificate to be recognized and the component for which recognition is sought, and submit the documents relevant for the assessment of recognition.

### §3.3 Procedure of the evaluation     
1. The evaluation shall be based on the clearly defined description of the evaluation item in the contract and shall include at least one evaluation of the documentation provided by the Applicant (para. 2), inquires and interviews (para. 3) and an on-site evaluation (para. 4). In the case of Component Certification, technical tests (para. 5) shall be carried out.
2. With the documentary assessment, the evaluator checks compliance with the requirements of the IDS on the basis of the information in the Applicant\'s documentation.
3. Interviewing the Applicant\'s staff or other persons involved in the provisioning of the evaluation item may be used to determine the facts of individual aspects and to verify the accuracy of the documentation.
In particular, it shall be used to verify aspects identified as critical by the evaluator. Inquiries can be conducted in writing or in person.
In any case, those concerning central aspects should be conducted as oral interviews.
Where a personal interview would be disproportionate, it may take the form of videoconferencing.
4. The on-premise evaluation shall include at least an evaluation of the procedures on the premises of the Applicant or its subcontractors.
5. In the case of Component Certification, appropriate functional and security tests are conducted.
6. The evaluation covers all requirements of the IDS for the selected Trust and Assurance Level.
7. The evaluation should be carried out on a sample basis. In relation to a request (e.g. secure passwords), a sample of activities is to be evaluated in order to fulfill a requirement (e.g. password length).
With regard to the implementation of individual activities, a sample of elements (e.g. individual passwords) shall be evaluated.
8. The sample shall be selected in such a way that the evaluation of the selected activities or elements provides an indication of the compliance with the requirement.

### §3.4 Recognition of certificates     
1. The Certification Body shall recognize relevant certificates for the object of evaluation or individual components thereof.
The evaluation of the covered criteria for the component named in the certificate is then not necessary.
However, it is necessary to evaluate criteria not covered by this certificate as well as the interaction of the recognized component with other components, in particular the interfaces relevant to that interaction.
2. If the Applicant seeks recognition, the Evaluation Facility shall evaluate without delay whether and to what extent recognition can be granted.
3. The Evaluation Facility shall ask the Certification Body for a preliminary ruling on the recognition of certificates. The request shall be accompanied at least by the particulars and documents referred to in § 3.2 (4).

### §3.5 Assessment and evaluation report     
1. On the basis of the evaluation, the evaluator shall prepare an assessment of the operational environment\'s or the component\'s compliance with the requirements of the IDS in relation to a specific Trust and Assurance Level.
This requires both an assessment of the fulfillment of the individual requirements of the IDS and of the fulfillment of the requirements of the IDS as a whole, each relating to a specific Trust and Assurance Level.
2. If individual organizational requirements of the IDS Certification for the Trust Level applied for are not met, these may be offset by other measures if the operational environment or the component thereby achieves the overall level of protection of the Trust Level applied for.
If the Evaluation Facility accepts such compensation, this shall be justified separately to the Certification Body in the statement of the overall result.
3. The Evaluation Facility shall draw up an evaluation report on the basis of the evaluation.
The evaluation report shall include at least the following information:
* a. the subject matter of the evaluation;
* b. a description of the timing and scope of the evaluation, including the locations and premises where it was conducted;
* c. a brief description (a few sentences or keywords) of the implementation of each IDS requirement;
* d. the reasoned assessment regarding the fulfillment or non-compliance of the individual IDS requirements for the Trust Level concerned;
* e. the measures by which the Evaluation Facility has verified the fulfillment, in particular information on the evaluation method pursuant to § 3.3 paras. 2 to 6 and - if necessary for understanding - a justification for its use;
* f. the indication of the certificates to be recognized as well as a statement on the evaluation of the interaction of the components;
* g. a justification of the equivalence of certificates to be recognized within the meaning of § 4.5.
* h. the overall result with regard to the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of the IDS requirements for a specific Trust Level;
* i. the justification of the overall result;
* j. a list of the reviewed documentation;
* k. the declaration of the Applicant in accordance with section 3.2(3);
* l. the declaration of the evaluator that he has met the requirements of these Rules of Procedure for independence and impartiality and that there is no cause for concern of bias.
4. The evaluation report may contain additional hints.
The hints may also indicate whether and through which measures the Applicant is still able to meet IDS requirements that have not yet been achieved.
5. The evaluation item shall be described in detail in the evaluation report.
In particular, the function of the operational environments or components must be described and delimited in detail.
6. The name of the evaluation item may be given in an appendix to the evaluation report, but in any case it must be unambiguous.
7. The Evaluation Facility submits a draft of the evaluation report to the Certification Body for comments.
The final version of the evaluation report may only be submitted to the Applicant after the Certification Body has given its comments.
8. The Applicant may only make the evaluation report available to third parties in full text, stating the date of issue, and pass it on after written approval by the Evaluation Facility.

### 3.6 Change Certification     
1. Change Certifications can be carried out at the Applicant\'s request.
2. During a change certification, the Certification Body must determine whether the certified operational environment or component continues to meet the IDS requirements of the originally certified Trust Level after changes have been made.
3. For small changes, e.g. bug fixes or security patches for components, the change can be certified with minimal effort in form of a maintenance certification.
For larger changes, e.g. to management processes of an organization or larger source code modifications for a component, a re-certification must be conducted.
4. For a maintenance certification, the Evaluation Facility evaluates the documented changes to determine whether they may result in a violation of the certified IDS requirements.
If that is the case, a deeper evaluation in form of a re-certification is required. The above requirements for evaluation apply accordingly except for § 3.3.
5. For a re-certification, all above requirements for evaluation apply accordingly.
The scope of the re-certifications shall be such that the changes to the operational environments or components made since the last evaluation are checked.
Appropriate sampling shall be used to determine whether the operational environment or component as a whole continues to meet the IDS requirements.
6. The Applicant is obliged to cooperate in accordance with § 3.2.
In particular, it shall prepare documentation of the changes to the technical and organizational measures in accordance with § 3.2 Para. 2.
