  **Rules of Procedure**

  **for the Certification of**

  **IDS Operational En-**

  **vironments and IDS**

  **Core Components**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Preamble**                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| Certification according to the International Da- ta Spaces            |
| Certification Scheme (IDS-CS) is available to all organizations       |
| participating in the IDS and developers of IDS core compo- nents.     |
| IDS-CS is a certification scheme devel- oped by the Working Group     |
| Certification on behalf of the International Data Spaces Asso-        |
| ciation.                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| The IDS-CS certification procedure has not yet been expressly         |
| regulated by law. A certifi- cate in accordance with IDS-CS may only  |
| be issued in accordance with the following Rules of Procedure.        |
|                                                                       |
| The IDS certification is intended to enable do- mestic and foreign    |
| companies to have them- selves certified as organizations             |
| participating in the IDS or the IDS core components imple- mented by  |
| them and, thus, to prove their con- formity with the IDSA reference   |
| architecture. Users of the IDS should be able to rely on the          |
| certification.                                                        |

| **1. Scope of application**                                           |
|                                                                       |
| **§ 1.1 Scope of application**                                        |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  The rules of procedure apply to evalua- tions and certifications  |
|     of operational environ- ments and core components in the IDS.     |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  The operational environment certification serves the purpose of   |
|     proving the trustworthi- ness of the participating organizations  |
|     by eval- uating the fulfillment of a number of technical and      |
|     procedural requirements for the opera- tional environment. For    |
|     the organization, the resulting certificate is the most important |
|     pre- requisite for access to the IDS.                             |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  The component certification required for participating in the IDS |
|     serves the purpose of proving the trustworthiness of the          |
|     developed components by evaluating the fulfillment of functional, |
|     security-relevant and procedural re- quirements. The certificate  |
|     is the most impor- tant prerequisite for a component being used   |
|     within the IDS.                                                   |

| **§ 1.2 Subject of the evaluation and certifi- cation**               |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  The certification approach for [operational]{.underline}          |
|     [environments]{.underline} is represented by two dimen- sions:    |
|     The horizontal dimension is the evalua- tion depth that describes |
|     the level of detail at which the evaluation takes place. The      |
|     vertical dimension is the increasing extent of the orga-          |
|     nizational security requirements to be met.                       |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  The [core component certification]{.underline} is inter-          |
|     operability and security oriented and aims at checking the        |
|     development and maintenance process as well as the implementation |
|     of a component. The component certification ap- proach is         |
|     represented by two dimensions: The depth of testing during        |
|     evaluation increases with each of the three defined assurance     |
|     lev- els. The three defined security profiles likewise increase   |
|     with the security needs of the data owner or data consumer in the |
|     IDS.                                                              |

| **§ 1.3 Relationship to DIN EN ISO/IEC 17065 and 27001**              |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  These rules of procedure are a certification program in the sense |
|     of ISO/IEC 17065.                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  The core components are products accord- ing to ISO/IEC 17065.    |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  The content of the operational environment certification          |
|     essentially corresponds to the content of a certification of the  |
|     information se- curity management system (ISMS) according to DIN  |
|     EN ISO/IEC 27001.                                                 |
+=======================================================================+

| **2. Certification body and eval- uation facility**                   |
|                                                                       |
| **§ 2.1 Certification body**                                          |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  The IDS certification is carried out by an independent and        |
|     technically suitable certifica- tion body. The certification body |
|     shall carry out its activities in a non-discriminatory and impar- |
|     tial manner.                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  The certification body may be a legal entity or a separate part   |
|     of a legal entity.                                                |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  The certification body must have the finan- cial stability and    |
|     resources necessary for the activity.                             |
|                                                                       |
| 4.  The certification body shall ensure the con- fidentiality of      |
|     information on and arising from the certification procedures.     |
|                                                                       |
| 5.  In the event of a positive evaluation, the certification body     |
|     issues a certificate to the ap- plicant.                          |

| **§ 2.3 Evaluation facility**                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  Independent and technically suitable eval- uation facilities can  |
|     be commissioned to evalu- ate the operational environment of a    |
|     participat- ing organization or the components of a manu-         |
|     facterer in order to issue an IDS certificate.                    |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  An evaluation facility is a legal entity or part of a legal       |
|     entity that employs evaluators to conduct evaluations in          |
|     accordance with these rules of procedure.                         |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  The evaluation facility shall carry out its ac- tivities in a     |
|     non-discriminatory and impartial manner in accordance with        |
|     section 2.7 sub- sections 1 and 2 and shall have the necessary    |
|     resources for the evaluation.                                     |
|                                                                       |
| 4.  The evaluation facility shall ensure the confidentiality of       |
|     information on and arising from the evaluation procedures.        |
|                                                                       |
| 5.  The evaluation facility may use its own or external evaluators to |
|     carry out the evaluation. For external evaluators, the same       |
|     competence requirements apply as in § 2.4 for evaluators employed |
|     by the evaluation facility.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| 6.  The evaluation facility shall demonstrate and maintain adequate   |
|     liability insurance.                                              |
|                                                                       |
| 7.  In principle, an evaluation facility may only carry out           |
|     evaluations for the IDS if it has been recognised by the IDS      |
|     certification body.                                               |

| **§ 2.4 Evaluators**                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  Evaluators are natural persons who carry out evaluations for an   |
|     evaluation facility in ac- cordance with these rules of           |
|     procedure.                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  They must have sufficient competence to carry out the             |
|     evaluations. This requires ade- quate training and experience.    |
|                                                                       |
| 3\.                                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| The evaluation requires a university degree or equivalent in the      |
| fields relevant to the evaluation. In particular, evaluators must     |
| have sufficient knowledge of the following subjects:                  |
|                                                                       |

| 1.  The certification body and evaluation fa- cilities may belong to  |
|     the same organization. In this case, evaluators and certifiers    |

| 1.  �� The certification body and evaluation facilities, certifiers   |
|     and evaluators are indepen- dent if they are free from external   |
|     and internal influence, in particular from financial influence.   |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  Certification body, evaluation facilities, cer- tifiers and       |
|     evaluators shall be impartial if they carry out their             |
|     certification and evaluation ac- tivities objectively in          |
|     accordance with these rules of procedure and do not allow them-   |

| Certification body and evaluation facilities shall ensure the         |
| independence and impartiality of the certifiers and evaluators        |
| through appropriate organizational measures. They obligate the        |
| certifiers and evaluators contractually to maintain their             |
| independence. In meeting the requirements of sentence 1 and sentence  |
| 2, the following principles in particular shall be taken into         |
| account:                                                              |

| a.  Any kind of influence by other persons or organizations on the    |
|     evaluations and their results is excluded.                        |
|                                                                       |
| b.  The income of certifiers and evaluators does not depend on the    |
|     certification, assessment or evaluation results and the number of |
|     certifications, assessments or evaluations carried out.           |
|                                                                       |
| c.  Certification and evaluation activities shall not be confused     |
|     with other tasks which, by their nature or intensity, may give    |
|     rise to a conflict of interest and, thus, have a negative impact  |
|     on the quality of the certification or evaluation activity.       |
|                                                                       |
| d.  Neither the certifiers and evaluators employed nor any other      |
|     staff directly or indirectly involved in the certification or     |
|     evaluation activity shall, at the time of certification or        |
|     evaluation, have any relationship with the applicant which goes   |
|     beyond the scope of the evaluation.                               |
|                                                                       |
| e.  Certifiers and evaluators shall not have undertaken any           |
|     consulting or other activity for the applicant which              |
|                                                                       |
| might compromise independence within the last two                     |

| 3.  The applicant assures the evaluation fa- cility and certification |
|     body that the measures specified in the documentation have been   |
|     fully implemented.                                                |

|     for his component or or- ganization, he shall communicate the     |
|     request for recognition before the start of the evalua- tion,     |
|     specifying the exact designation of the certificate to be         |
|     recognised and the compo- nent for which recognition is sought,   |
|     and sub- mit the documents relevant for the assessment of         |
|     recognition.                                                      |

| **§ 3.3 Procedure of the evaluation**                                 |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  The evaluation shall be based on the clearly defined description  |
|     of the evaluation item in the contract and shall include at least |
|     one evaluation of the documentation provid- ed by the applicant   |
|     (para. 2), inquires and in- terviews (para. 3) and an on-site     |
|     evaluation (para. 4). In the case of component certifica- tion,   |
|     technical tests (para. 5) shall be carried out.                   |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  With the documentary assessment, the evaluator checks compliance  |
|     with the require- ments of the IDS on the basis of the informa-   |
|     tion in the applicant\'s documentation.                           |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  Interviewing the applicant\'s staff or oth- er persons involved   |
|     in the provisioning of the                                        |
|                                                                       |
| evaluation item may be used to determine the facts of individual      |
| aspects and to verify the ac- curacy of the documentation. In         |
| particular, it shall be used to verify aspects identified as critical |
| by the evaluator. Inquiries can be con- ducted in writing or in       |
| person. In any case, those concerning central aspects should be       |
| conducted as oral interviews. Where a person- al interview would be   |
| disproportionate, it may take the form of videoconferencing.          |
|                                                                       |
| 4.  The on-premise evaluation shall include at least an evaluation of |
|     the procedures on the premises of the applicant or its            |
|     subcontractors.                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 5.  In the case of component certification, ap- propriate functional  |
|     and security tests are con- ducted.                               |
|                                                                       |
| 6.  The evaluation covers all requirements of the IDS for the         |
|     selected certification level.                                     |
|                                                                       |
| 7.  The evaluation should be carried out on a sample basis. In        |
|     relation to a request (e.g. se- cure passwords), a sample of      |
|     activities is to be evaluated in order to fulfil a requirement    |
|     (e.g. password length). With regard to the imple- mentation of    |
|     individual activities, a sample of                                |
|                                                                       |
| elements (e.g. individual passwords) shall be                         |
+=======================================================================+
| evaluated.                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| 8\. The sample shall be selected in such a way that the evaluation of |
| the selected activi-                                                  |

| **§ 3.4 Recognition of certificates**                                 |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  The certification body shall recognize rel- evant certificates    |
|     for the object of evaluation or individual components thereof.    |
|     The evalua- tion of the covered criteria for the component named  |
|     in the certificate is then not necessary. However, it is          |
|     necessary to evaluate criteria not covered by this certificate as |
|     well as the interaction of the recognised component with other    |
|     components, in particular the interfaces relevant to that         |
|     interaction.                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  If the applicant seeks recognition, the eval- uation facility     |
|     shall evaluate without delay whether and to what extent           |
|     recognition can be granted.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  The evaluation facility shall ask the cer- tification body for a  |
|     preliminary ruling on the recognition of certificates. The        |
|     request shall be accompanied at least by the particulars and      |
|     documents referred to in § 3.2 (4).                               |

| **§ 3.5 Assessment and evaluation report**                            |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  On the basis of the evaluation, the evalua- tor shall prepare an  |
|     assessment of the opera- tional environment\'s or the             |
|     component\'s com- pliance with the requirements of the IDS in re- |
|     lation to a specific certification level. This re- quires both an |
|     assessment of the fulfilment of the individual requirements of    |
|     the IDS and of the fulfilment of the requirements of the IDS as a |
|     whole, each relating to a specific certification level.           |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  If individual organizational requirements of the IDS              |
|     certification for the certification level applied for are not     |
|     met, these may be offset by other measures if the operational     |
|     environment or the component thereby achieves the overall level   |
|     of protection of the certification level ap- plied for. If the    |
|     evaluation facility accepts such compensation, this shall be      |
|     justified separately to the certification body in the statement   |
|     of the overall result.                                            |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| The evaluation facility shall draw up an evaluation report on the     |
| basis of the evaluation. The audit report shall include at least the  |
| following information:                                                |
|                                                                       |

| c.  a brief description of the implementation of each IDS             |
|     requirement;                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| d.  the reasoned assessment regarding the fulfilment or               |
|     non-compliance of the individual IDS requirements for the         |

|                                                                       |
| e.  the measures by which the evaluation facility has verified the    |
|     fulfilment, in particular information on the evaluation method    |
|     pursuant to § 3.3 paras. 2 to 6 and                               |
|                                                                       |

| **§ 3.6 Change Certification**                                        |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  Change Certifications can be carried out at the applicant\'s      |
|     request.                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  During a change certification the certifica- tion body must       |
|     determine whether the certified operational environment or        |
|     component contin- ues to meet the IDS requirements of the orig-   |
|     inaly certified certification level after changes have been made. |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  For small changes, e.g. bug fixes or securi- ty patches for       |
|     components, the change can be certified with minimal effort in    |
|     form of a main- tenance certification. For larger changes, e.g.   |
|     to managment processes of an organization or larger source code   |
|     modifications for a compo- nent, a re-certification must be       |
|     conducted.                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| 4.  For a maintenance certification, the evalua- tion facility        |
|     evaluates the documented changes to determine whether they may    |
|     result in a vio- lation of the certified IDS requirements. If     |
|     that is the case, a deeper evaluation in form of a                |
|                                                                       |
| re-certification is required. The above require- ments for evaluation |
| apply accordingly except for § 3.3.                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 5.  For a re-certification, all above require- ments for evaluation   |
|     apply accordingly. The scope of the re-certifications shall be    |
|     such that the changes to the operational environments or          |
|     components made since the last evaluation are checked.            |
|     Appropriate sampling shall be used to determine whether the       |
|     operational en- vironment or component as a whole continues to    |
|     meet the IDS requirements.                                        |
|                                                                       |
| 6.  The applicant is obliged to cooperate in accordance with § 3.2.   |
|     In particular, it shall prepare documentation of the changes to   |
|     the technical and organizational measures in ac- cordance with §  |
|     3.2 Para. 2.                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| 7.  The evaluation facility prepares a evalu- ation report and sends  |
|     it to the certification                                           |
|                                                                       |
| body.                                                                 |

| 1\. The certification procedure is based on a contract between the    |
| applicant and the certifi- cation body.                               |
|                                                                       |

| **§ 4.2 Requirements for certification**                              |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  The granting of the certificate re- quires an evaluation of the   |
|     participating organization\'s operational environment or          |
|                                                                       |
| component by an evaluation facility in accor- dance with these rules  |
| of procedure. The ap- plicant shall designate the evaluation          |
| facility.                                                             |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  Recognised evaluation facilities are listed in a list maintained  |
|     by the certification body with- in the meaning of § 2.6.          |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  After signing of the contract, the certifica- tion body appoints  |
|     a responsible certifier to the applicant and the evaluation       |
|     facility.                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 4.  The evaluation facility appoints to the certi- fication body the  |
|     responsible (principal) evalu- ator whom it has entrusted with    |
|     the evaluation.                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 5.  The certifier coordinates the evaluation ob- ject, the scope, the |
|     duration and the schedule of the evaluation with the responsible  |
|     evalu- ator and the applicant. The coordination shall also cover  |
|     intended recognition of existing cer- tificates.                  |
|                                                                       |
| 6.  The certification body may reserve the right to participate in    |
|     the on-site evaluation in whole or in part. However, it may not   |
|     carry out any evaluation procedures or intervene in the eval-     |
|     uation process.                                                   |
+=======================================================================+
|                                                                       |

| **§ 4.3 Assessment of the evaluation**                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  By evaluating the evaluation report, the certification body       |
|     determines whether the eval- uation was conducted properly, in    |
|     particular whether it meets the requirements of these procedural  |
|     rules, and whether the participating organization or component    |
|     meets the IDS re- quirements at the certification level applied   |
|     for.                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  The certification body may request further explanations or        |
|     additions to the evaluation re- port from the evaluation          |
|     facility.                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  In consultation with the evaluation facility, the certification   |
|     body may collect information and evidence from the applicant      |
|     insofar as this is necessary for the certification decision.      |

| **§ 4.4 Recognition of IDS certificates**                             |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  The certification body shall recognise IDS certificates for       |
|     components of the participat- ing organization or component to    |
|     the extent of their validity and certification level, provided    |
|     that they have been issued in accordance with these Rules of      |
|     Procedure.                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  In the event of recognition, the certificate may be issued for    |
|     the full period of validity in accordance with § 5.3. The         |
|     certificate shall be revoked if a recognised certificate expires. |
|     This shall not apply if the relevant component is immediately     |
|     re-certified and the certificate can be recognised, or if the     |
|     component is im- mediately included in the certificate for the    |
|     operational environment or component by a change certification    |
|     according to § 4.9.                                               |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  The certification body shall monitor the va- lidity of the        |
|     recognised certificates. It shall in- form the applicant in good  |
|     time of the immi- nent expiry of the validity periods of recog-   |
|     nised certificates.                                               |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **§ 4.5 Recognition of other certificates**                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  The certification body may recognize other certificates if they   |
|     are materially and procedu- rally equivalent to an IDS            |
|     certificate. The certi- fication body determines the              |
|     certification level at which the certificate is recognised.       |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  A material equivalence exists if the other certificate is based   |
|     on requirements that are comparable to or exceed those of the IDS |
|     with regard to the certification level.                           |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  A procedural equivalence exists if the oth- er certificate was    |
|     granted in a certification pro- cedure that offers a comparable   |
|     guarantee for the proper evaluation and certification in ac-      |
|     cordance with these procedural rules.                             |
|                                                                       |
| 4\.                                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| The following certificates are generally considered to be materially  |
| and procedurely equivalent:                                           |
|                                                                       |
| -   certificates according to ISO 27001;                              |
|                                                                       |
| -   certificates according to ISO 27001 based on IT- Grundschutz;     |
|                                                                       |
| -   certificates according to ISO 15408;                              |
|                                                                       |
| -   certificates according to IEC 62443.                              |
|                                                                       |
| 5.  The certification body shall justify the recognition, in          |
|     particular with regard to the cer- tification level.              |
|                                                                       |
| 6.  In the event of recognition, § 4.4 paras. 2 to 3 apply            |
|     accordingly.                                                      |

| **§ 4.6 Decision of the certification body**                          |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  The certification body shall decide on the award of the           |
|     certificate on the basis of the evaluation report, the assessment |
|     by the certi- fier and, if necessary, further findings.           |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  The certificate must be issued to the extent requested if the     |
|     participant or component fulfils the corresponding IDS            |
|     requirements.                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  In the event of deviations from the require- ments, the           |
|     certificate for the participants may be issued provisionally for  |
|     up to six months if this is linked to a fixed catalogue of        |
|     measures whose implementation is checked. Significant deviations  |
|     do not permit provisional certifica- tion. A principle granting   |
|     of the certificate for participants or components with            |
|     restrictions is not possible.                                     |
|                                                                       |
| 4.  If a participant or component does not meet the IDS requirements, |
|     the issuance of the certificate shall be refused.                 |
|                                                                       |
| 5.  Reasons shall be given where the decision falls short of the      |
|     application.                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| 6.  The certification decision shall be an- nounced to the applicant. |
|     The certification de- cision shall contain all information on     |
|     recog- nized certificates and the information pursuant to § 4.5   |
|     para. 5.                                                          |
+=======================================================================+
|                                                                       |

| **§ 4.7 Rectification of defects**                                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  The certification body may give the appli- cant the opportunity,  |
|     before or after a decision to grant the certificate has been      |
|     taken, to rec- tify the situation and to modify his application   |
|     for certification.                                                |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  If the participant or the component fulfills the IDS requirements |
|     according to the original or modified certification application   |
|     due to the subsequent improvement, the certificate must be issued |
|     accordingly.                                                      |

| **§ 4.8 Objection**                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  The applicant may lodge an appeal with the certification body     |
|     against a decision by which he is adversely affected. The         |
|     contradic- tion must be substantiated. A complaint exists if the  |
|     certification decision falls short of the ap- plication.          |
|                                                                       |
| 2.  The objection must be submitted in text form within a period of 4 |
|     weeks after receipt of the certification decision.                |
|                                                                       |
| 3.  The certification body shall verify whether the objection is      |
|     justified.                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| 4.  If the objection is directed against the eval- uation or the      |
|     findings of the evaluation facility, the certification body shall |
|     inform the evalua- tion facility of the objection and obtain a    |
|     state- ment from the evaluation facility.                         |
|                                                                       |
| 5.  If the objection is justified, the certification body shall amend |
|     the certification decision. If the certification body does not    |
|     remedy the ob- jection, this shall be justified.                  |
|                                                                       |
| 6.  The decision on the opposition, including the statement of        |
|     grounds, shall be communi- cated to the applicant in text form.   |

| **§ 4.9 Change certification**                                        |
|                                                                       |
| 1.  At the applicant\'s request, the certification body may change    |
|     the certificate by means of a change certification. In the event  |
|     of an amend- ment, the certificate shall continue to exist for    |
|     its original period of validity.                                  |
