**PART 1 -** CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK

Participants and core components shall provide a sufficiently high
degree of security regarding the integrity, confidentiality and
availability of information exchanged in the Industrial Data Space.
Therefore, an evaluation and certification of the core components as
well as of the technical and organizational security measures is
mandatory for participating in the Industrial Data Space.

This requirement for compliance necessitates the definition of a
framework in order to ensure a consistent and comparable evaluation
and certification

process amongst all Industrial Data Space participants and core
components. Hence, a certification scheme has been defined following
best practices from other internationally accredited certifications.
All certification-related roles described in this paper are specific
to the Industrial Data Space, i.e. terms such as "Certification Body"
should not be misunderstood to refer to an existing organization
already granting certificates. As part of the scheme implementation
in 2018, the roles defined here will be assigned to actual
organizations.

Figure 1: International Data Spaces Certification - Roles &
Responsibilities

## International Data Spaces Association

The Industrial Data Space initially originated as a German research
initiative. Nevertheless, the initiative driven forward by the
International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) always had a wider scope
in mind, by addressing more and more international members and
component developers, as the initiative keeps growing. As such, the
initial development of operation of the Industrial Data Space certification scheme will mainly be led by German IDSA members. However,
for a future internationalization of the IDS certification, a
two-phase process has been designed:

-   Phase 1 - Increasing number of international members and developers:

To ensure an economically sound and from the applicant\'s point of
view, sufficiently accessible certification, the evaluation step of a
certification will be conducted by an evaluation facility located in
the applicant\'s country of residence. The certification step, carried
out by the Certification Body, together with the approval of inter-
national evaluation facilities, however will remain located solely
within a single entity. This aims to ensure that the overall framework
governance for the certification scheme stays manageable.

-   Phase 2 - Increasing overall number of members and developers:

At this stage, individual certification bodies in the member countries
will be commissioned in order to avoid a bottleneck situation, arising
from a single certification body. As such, both the evaluation and the
certification will be conducted by organizations located in the
applicant's country of residence. Once this happens, mutual control processes must be established to ensure that the evaluation and
certification processes are equivalent in all member nations. This
will be a prerequisite for mutually recognizing the IDS certificates
issued by the other nations. These costly measures will be justified,
once a substantial market position for the Industrial Data Space in
a number of nations has been reached.

The International Data Spaces Association appoints the IDS
Certification Body.

Its responsibilities in the context of the certification scheme
include:

-   Defining the requirements for the Certification Body and
   verification of the required technical competencies.

-   Monitoring of the Certification Body to ensure a consistent level of
   quality for the certification of Industrial Data Space participants
   and core components.

-   Monitoring of the current regulatory and legal requirements to
   evaluate and react to possible influences to the certification
   scheme.

-   Provisioning of recommendations to the Certification Body based on
   the results of its monito- ring activities.

-   Continuous improvement of the defined certification scheme
   including the incorporation of the feedback provided by the
   Certification Body.

The IDSA is not actively involved in a participant or core component
certification and the approval of Evaluation Facilities for performing
Industrial Data Space evaluations.

## Certification Body

The IDS Certification Body is appointed by the International Data
Spaces Association and regularly aligns with the IDSA to manage the
certification process, defines the standardized evaluation procedures and supervises the actions of the Evaluation Facilities.

Its responsibilities include:

-   Formulating and defining the certification scheme in cooperation
   with the International Data Spaces Association, including the
   evaluation procedures, participant and core component certification approaches as well as their underlying criteria
   catalogues.

## Evaluation Facility

-   Ensuring correct implementation and execution of the Industrial Data
   Space certification scheme, including the supervision of ongoing
   evaluations.

-   Ensuring continuous adherence to the Industrial Data Space
   certification scheme following up on changes und updates received
   from the IDSA.

-   Analyzing existing "base" certificates (e.g. for organizations or
   for software and hardware security components) to determine their
   validity and sufficiency, and deciding about their acceptance within
   the Industrial Data Space certification scheme.

-   Reviewing and commenting on the evaluation reports received from
   Evaluation Facilities.

-   Approval of applications for certification.

-   Making final decision about the award or denial of a certificate and
   publishing the awarded certificates.

-   Authorization/triggering of the generation and revocation of a X.509
   certificate. These certificates digitally represent the evaluation
   certificate and enable automated trust checks between partners
   prior to data transfer within the Indus- trial Data Space.

-   Decision about approval or exclusion of Evaluation Facilities
   for/from executing Industrial Data Space evaluations (based on
   ongoing monitoring and [CRIT-EF]).

-   Ongoing monitoring of certification-relevant external developments
   (e.g. new attack patterns which might circumvent certified security
   measures).

-   Providing input based on the practical quality assurance experiences
   to future updates of the Industrial Data Space certification scheme
   to the International Data Spaces Association.

The Certification Body only grants the certificate (called evaluation
certificate subsequently) only if both the Evaluation Facility and the
experts of the Certification Body have come to the conclusion that all
preconditions are fulfilled.

An Evaluation Facility is contracted by an Applicant and is as such
responsible for carrying out the detailed technical and/or
organizational evaluation work during a certification. The Evaluation
Facility issues an evaluation report for the participant or core
component, listing details regarding the per- formed evaluation
actions as well as information regarding the confirmed security level.
The depth and scope of the performed evaluation actions depend on the
desired level of security. These security levels are specified in
more detail in Part 2 and 3 of this document.

The responsibilities of the Evaluation Facility include:

-   Obtaining approval by the Certification Body to perform evaluations,
   based on an approval process with criteria defining personnel
   competencies and organizational requirements [CRIT-EF].

-   Applying the criteria specified in the Industrial Data Space
   certification scheme according to generally accepted standards and
   best practices (including the execution of any necessary tests and
   on-site checks).

-   Documenting the results in an evaluation report.

-   Providing the evaluation report to the Certification Body.

The term Evaluation Facility is used throughout the document to refer
both to authorized auditors for management system evaluations (i.e.,
participant certifications), as well as approved evaluators for
product evaluations (i.e., core component certifications). Hence,
multiple approved Evaluation Facilities will exist in the Industrial
Data Space certification scheme, but in each evaluation only one
Evaluation Facility will be involved.

The flexibility of the certification approaches defined in Part 2 and
3 of this document allows for a wide range of evaluation experts to
participate in the Industrial Data Space certification scheme, such as
software penetration testers, common criteria specialists, ISO 27001
auditors and accounting firms. As such, it is fully expected that all
certification levels defined in this document and therefore the needs
of startup companies and SMEs as well as those of large corporations
will be sufficiently addressed.

## Applicant

The Applicant plays an active part in the certification process. As
such, the responsibilities of the respective organization include:

-   Contract an approved (by the Certification Body) Evaluation Facility
   to carry out the evaluation according to the Industrial Data Space
   certification scheme.

-   Formally apply for certification (with the Certification Body) in
   order to trigger the start of the certification process.

-   Provide the necessary resources in terms of financing and personnel.

-   Communicate swiftly with and provide all necessary information and
   evidence to the Evaluation Facility and the Certification Body.

-   React adequately to findings occurring during the course of the
   evaluation.

All Applicants need to actively submit an application to start the
certification process and have the duties as listed above. This
applies to both organizations that develop software components
intended to be deployed within the Industrial Data Space (i.e., prospective software providers) and to organizations that intend to
become participants in the Industrial Data Space. During the
certification process, the primary focus of the evaluation will be
either on the product or on the organization itself.

##  Identity Provider

The Identity Provider creates, maintains and verifies technical
identities for the applicant. This hap- pens by using technical X.509
certificates that are not directly related to the certificates
described in this paper. Technical identities associate attributes to
entities. This happens when a certification level is assigned to an
Applicant or a component. Central records for membership status and
issued certifications are kept by the IDSA and are modelled into
technical identities (e.g., by handing out X.509 certificates or
attribute tokens to verify dynamic attributes for entities). So the
Identity Provider asserts identity attributes towards other entities
and verifies the validity of issued technical certificates. Examples
for attributes might be

-   Organizational certification status

-   Expiry data of a certification status

-   Connector security level

These attributes can be used for access & usage control decisions. For
more information on identity management in the Industrial Data Space,
see the IDS Reference Architecture Model [IDSRA, 4.1.3].

## Issuance of Certificates

![Issuance of Certificates](media/fig2_.png)Figure 2: International Data Spaces Certification --
Issuance of Certificates

After a successfully completed evaluation, the Certification Body
awards an Industrial Data Space evaluation certificate to the
applicant. These certificates will have a limited validity period.
In order to renew a certificate before it expires, a re-certification
is required, taking into account any relevant external developments
that have happened in the meantime. Similarly, re-certification is
required if changes are made to the target of certification; in case
of minor changes, "lightweight", low-cost re-certification may be
sufficient. The definition of major and minor changes will follow the
definition used within widely accepted certification standards such as
ISO 27001.

For authentication and authorization, each IDS component must have a
valid X.509 certificate, in order to verify the identity of other
participants. These technical certificates digitally represent the
evaluation certificate and enable automated trust checks between
partners prior to data transfer within the Industrial Data Space. Upon
a successful certification of an organization, such a technical
certificate is issued to the organization to confirm certain attributes like organizational name, certification status, etc. This
technical certificate can be used to trigger processes such as
applying for X.509 connector certificates.
