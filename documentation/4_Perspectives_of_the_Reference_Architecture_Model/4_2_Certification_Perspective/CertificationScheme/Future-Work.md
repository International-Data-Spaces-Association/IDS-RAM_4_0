**PART 5 --** FUTURE WORK

After having finalized version 1 of the Certification Criteria
Catalogues for IDS Participants and Core Components, the Working Group
will focus next on the Criteria Catalogue for IDS Evaluation
Facilities.

It is foreseen that the IDS Certification Body, on top of being
monitored by the IDSA, will be accredited by the national
accreditation body (e.g., DAkkS in Germany) in the future. Its
responsibilities in the context of the IDS Certification Scheme will
include:

-   Auditing the Certification Body to verify, for example, their
   adherence to regulatory and normative requirements4.

-   Provisioning of recommendations to the Certification Body based on
   the results of its monito- ring activities.

The Accreditation Body will be a nationally unique entity, supervising
the nations certificate-gran- ting institutions. It will not be
actively involved in a participant or core component certification and
the approval of Evaluation Facilities for performing Industrial Data
Space evaluations.
