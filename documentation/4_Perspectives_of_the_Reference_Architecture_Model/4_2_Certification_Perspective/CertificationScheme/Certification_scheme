# INTRODUCTION

 The Industrial Data Space is a virtual data space leveraging existing
 standards and technologies, as well as accepted governance models, to
 facilitate the secure exchange and easy linkage of data in a trusted
 business ecosystem. The Industrial Data Space is an initiative that is
 institutionalized by two main activities: the Fraunhofer research pro-
 jects »Industrial Data Space« and »Industrial Data Space Plus« as well
 as the »International Data Spaces Association«. While the research
 projects are concerned with the design and implementation of the
 Reference Architecture Model, the IDSA unites the requirements from
 various industries and pro- vides use cases to test the results gained
 from its implementation.

 Data security and data sovereignty are the fundamental
 characteristics of the Industrial Data Space. Data sovereignty is a
 natural person's or legal entity's capability of exclusive
 self-determination with regard to their data goods. Participants
 within the Industrial Data Space must therefore use certified software
 (e.g., the »Industrial Data

 Space Connector«) in order to securely exchange data in a sovereign
 way. Furthermore, data is only ex- changed if the exchange takes place
 between trust- worthy and certified participants. This document
 therefore presents the approach to participant and core component
 certification within the Industrial Data Space.

 The Industrial Data Space certification scheme encompasses all
 processes, rules and standards governing the certification of
 participants and core components within the Industrial Data Space. The
 purpose of this document is therefore to present the framework for the
 scheme's structure, processes, evaluation levels and criteria
 catalogues as defined by the Working Group Certification of the
 International Data Spaces Association. As such, this paper illustrates
 the core of our ambition for crafting a flexible and cost-effective
 certification scheme. As this is a work in progress, adjustments to
 the certification scheme may be made in the future and published in
 updated versions of this document.

 **PART 1 -** CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK

 Participants and core components shall provide a sufficiently high
 degree of security regarding the integrity, confidentiality and
 availability of information exchanged in the Industrial Data Space.
 Therefore, an evaluation and certification of the core components as
 well as of the technical and organizational security measures is
 mandatory for participating in the Industrial Data Space.

 This requirement for compliance necessitates the definition of a
 framework in order to ensure a consistent and comparable evaluation
 and certification

 process amongst all Industrial Data Space participants and core
 components. Hence, a certification scheme has been defined following
 best practices from other internationally accredited certifications.
 All certification-related roles described in this paper are specific
 to the Industrial Data Space, i.e. terms such as "Certification Body"
 should not be misunderstood to refer to an existing organization
 already granting certificates. As part of the scheme implementation
 in 2018, the roles defined here will be assigned to actual
 organizations.

 Figure 1: Industrial Data Space Certification - Roles &
 Responsibilities

## International Data Spaces Association

 The Industrial Data Space initially originated as a German research
 initiative. Nevertheless, the initiative driven forward by the
 International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) always had a wider scope
 in mind, by addressing more and more international members and
 component developers, as the initiative keeps growing. As such, the
 initial development of operation of the Industrial Data Space certification scheme will mainly be led by German IDSA members. However,
 for a future internationalization of the IDS certification, a
 two-phase process has been designed:

-   Phase 1 - Increasing number of international members and developers:

 To ensure an economically sound and from the applicant\'s point of
 view, sufficiently accessible certification, the evaluation step of a
 certification will be conducted by an evaluation facility located in
 the applicant\'s country of residence. The certification step, carried
 out by the Certification Body, together with the approval of inter-
 national evaluation facilities, however will remain located solely
 within a single entity. This aims to ensure that the overall framework
 governance for the certification scheme stays manageable.

-   Phase 2 - Increasing overall number of members and developers:

 At this stage, individual certification bodies in the member countries
 will be commissioned in order to avoid a bottleneck situation, arising
 from a single certification body. As such, both the evaluation and the
 certification will be conducted by organizations located in the
 applicant's country of residence. Once this happens, mutual control processes must be established to ensure that the evaluation and
 certification processes are equivalent in all member nations. This
 will be a prerequisite for mutually recognizing the IDS certificates
 issued by the other nations. These costly measures will be justified,
 once a substantial market position for the Industrial Data Space in
 a number of nations has been reached.

 The International Data Spaces Association appoints the IDS
 Certification Body.

 Its responsibilities in the context of the certification scheme
 include:

-   Defining the requirements for the Certification Body and
    verification of the required technical competencies.

-   Monitoring of the Certification Body to ensure a consistent level of
    quality for the certification of Industrial Data Space participants
    and core components.

-   Monitoring of the current regulatory and legal requirements to
    evaluate and react to possible influences to the certification
    scheme.

-   Provisioning of recommendations to the Certification Body based on
    the results of its monito- ring activities.

-   Continuous improvement of the defined certification scheme
    including the incorporation of the feedback provided by the
    Certification Body.

 The IDSA is not actively involved in a participant or core component
 certification and the approval of Evaluation Facilities for performing
 Industrial Data Space evaluations.

## Certification Body

 The IDS Certification Body is appointed by the International Data
 Spaces Association and regularly aligns with the IDSA to manage the
 certification process, defines the standardized evaluation procedures and supervises the actions of the Evaluation Facilities.

 Its responsibilities include:

-   Formulating and defining the certification scheme in cooperation
    with the International Data Spaces Association, including the
    evaluation procedures, participant and core component certification approaches as well as their underlying criteria
    catalogues.

## Evaluation Facility

-   Ensuring correct implementation and execution of the Industrial Data
    Space certification scheme, including the supervision of ongoing
    evaluations.

-   Ensuring continuous adherence to the Industrial Data Space
    certification scheme following up on changes und updates received
    from the IDSA.

-   Analyzing existing "base" certificates (e.g. for organizations or
    for software and hardware security components) to determine their
    validity and sufficiency, and deciding about their acceptance within
    the Industrial Data Space certification scheme.

-   Reviewing and commenting on the evaluation reports received from
    Evaluation Facilities.

-   Approval of applications for certification.

-   Making final decision about the award or denial of a certificate and
    publishing the awarded certificates.

-   Authorization/triggering of the generation and revocation of a X.509
    certificate. These certificates digitally represent the evaluation
    certificate and enable automated trust checks between partners
    prior to data transfer within the Indus- trial Data Space.

-   Decision about approval or exclusion of Evaluation Facilities
    for/from executing Industrial Data Space evaluations (based on
    ongoing monitoring and [CRIT-EF]).

-   Ongoing monitoring of certification-relevant external developments
    (e.g. new attack patterns which might circumvent certified security
    measures).

-   Providing input based on the practical quality assurance experiences
    to future updates of the Industrial Data Space certification scheme
    to the International Data Spaces Association.

 The Certification Body only grants the certificate (called evaluation
 certificate subsequently) only if both the Evaluation Facility and the
 experts of the Certification Body have come to the conclusion that all
 preconditions are fulfilled.

 An Evaluation Facility is contracted by an Applicant and is as such
 responsible for carrying out the detailed technical and/or
 organizational evaluation work during a certification. The Evaluation
 Facility issues an evaluation report for the participant or core
 component, listing details regarding the per- formed evaluation
 actions as well as information regarding the confirmed security level.
 The depth and scope of the performed evaluation actions depend on the
 desired level of security. These security levels are specified in
 more detail in Part 2 and 3 of this document.

 The responsibilities of the Evaluation Facility include:

-   Obtaining approval by the Certification Body to perform evaluations,
    based on an approval process with criteria defining personnel
    competencies and organizational requirements [CRIT-EF].

-   Applying the criteria specified in the Industrial Data Space
    certification scheme according to generally accepted standards and
    best practices (including the execution of any necessary tests and
    on-site checks).

-   Documenting the results in an evaluation report.

-   Providing the evaluation report to the Certification Body.

 The term Evaluation Facility is used throughout the document to refer
 both to authorized auditors for management system evaluations (i.e.,
 participant certifications), as well as approved evaluators for
 product evaluations (i.e., core component certifications). Hence,
 multiple approved Evaluation Facilities will exist in the Industrial
 Data Space certification scheme, but in each evaluation only one
 Evaluation Facility will be involved.

 The flexibility of the certification approaches defined in Part 2 and
 3 of this document allows for a wide range of evaluation experts to
 participate in the Industrial Data Space certification scheme, such as
 software penetration testers, common criteria specialists, ISO 27001
 auditors and accounting firms. As such, it is fully expected that all
 certification levels defined in this document and therefore the needs
 of startup companies and SMEs as well as those of large corporations
 will be sufficiently addressed.

## Applicant

 The Applicant plays an active part in the certification process. As
 such, the responsibilities of the respective organization include:

-   Contract an approved (by the Certification Body) Evaluation Facility
    to carry out the evaluation according to the Industrial Data Space
    certification scheme.

-   Formally apply for certification (with the Certification Body) in
    order to trigger the start of the certification process.

-   Provide the necessary resources in terms of financing and personnel.

-   Communicate swiftly with and provide all necessary information and
    evidence to the Evaluation Facility and the Certification Body.

-   React adequately to findings occurring during the course of the
    evaluation.

 All Applicants need to actively submit an application to start the
 certification process and have the duties as listed above. This
 applies to both organizations that develop software components
 intended to be deployed within the Industrial Data Space (i.e., prospective software providers) and to organizations that intend to
 become participants in the Industrial Data Space. During the
 certification process, the primary focus of the evaluation will be
 either on the product or on the organization itself.

##  Identity Provider

 The Identity Provider creates, maintains and verifies technical
 identities for the applicant. This hap- pens by using technical X.509
 certificates that are not directly related to the certificates
 described in this paper. Technical identities associate attributes to
 entities. This happens when a certification level is assigned to an
 Applicant or a component. Central records for membership status and
 issued certifications are kept by the IDSA and are modelled into
 technical identities (e.g., by handing out X.509 certificates or
 attribute tokens to verify dynamic attributes for entities). So the
 Identity Provider asserts identity attributes towards other entities
 and verifies the validity of issued technical certificates. Examples
 for attributes might be

-   Organizational certification status

-   Expiry data of a certification status

-   Connector security level

 These attributes can be used for access & usage control decisions. For
 more information on identity management in the Industrial Data Space,
 see the IDS Reference Architecture Model [IDSRA, 4.1.3].

## Issuance of Certificates

 ![](media/image15.png)Figure 2: Industrial Data Space Certification --
 Issuance of Certificates

 After a successfully completed evaluation, the Certification Body
 awards an Industrial Data Space evaluation certificate to the
 applicant. These certificates will have a limited validity period.
 In order to renew a certificate before it expires, a re-certification
 is required, taking into account any relevant external developments
 that have happened in the meantime. Similarly, re-certification is
 required if changes are made to the target of certification; in case
 of minor changes, "lightweight", low-cost re-certification may be
 sufficient. The definition of major and minor changes will follow the
 definition used within widely accepted certification standards such as
 ISO 27001.

 For authentication and authorization, each IDS component must have a
 valid X.509 certificate, in order to verify the identity of other
 participants. These technical certificates digitally represent the
 evaluation certificate and enable automated trust checks between
 partners prior to data transfer within the Industrial Data Space. Upon
 a successful certification of an organization, such a technical
 certificate is issued to the organization to confirm certain attributes like organizational name, certification status, etc. This
 technical certificate can be used to trigger processes such as
 applying for X.509 connector certificates.

 **PART 2 -** PARTICIPANT CERTIFICATION

 One of the Industrial Data Space goals is to evolve to- wards a global
 de-facto standard for cross-industrial and cross-company information
 exchange. There- fore, a low financial and procedural barrier to join
 the Industrial Data Space is inevitable. It must there- fore be
 ensured that participants of the Industrial Data Space fulfill a
 certain level of security in order to comply with the security
 requirements set by the Industrial Data Space.

 The participants of the Industrial Data Space will collaborate by
 sharing their valuable information and data. Trust between the
 involved participants is necessary for such a collaboration.
 Furthermore it is essential for the Industrial Data Space and its
 reputation that the participants are trustworthy. This trust can be
 achieved by evaluating participants regarding their fulfilment of the
 defined levels of security, including infrastructure reliability and
 process compliance. To build this trust in a structured and ongoing
 way the Industrial Data Space established a well-defined process for
 participant certification.

 This participant certification is based on established certification
 standards and methods, as described in the following chapter
 Certification Criteria Catalogue. Therefore the certification of one
 participant demonstrates a level of security regarding availability,
 confidentiality and integrity to all other participants and
 stakeholder. So the process for participant certification as
 described below is building the necessary trust in the participants of
 the Industrial Data Space.

 To ensure on the one hand a low entry barrier specifically suitable
 for SMEs and on the other hand a scalable certification to meet high
 information security requirements, the matrix certification approach
 as shown in Figure 4 was defined for the certification of
 participants.

 The participant certification approach is displayed by two dimensions.
 The horizontal dimension is the Evaluation Depth, describing the level
 of detail at which an evaluation is performed. The vertical dimension
 is the increasing extent of the Security Requirements that need to be
 fulfilled.

## Evaluation Depth

 The horizontal dimension Evaluation Depth consists of the following
 three layers, with only the second and third layer containing actual
 evaluation tasks:

#### Self-Assessment

 A Self-Assessment is a mere self-declaration by the prospective
 participant in order to clarify the participant's identity and the
 provisioning of information about the participant's systems. No
 evaluator is involved in performing a self-assessment and no
 information of contained in a self-assessment is validated by an
 evaluation facility.

 Due to the fact that no evaluator is involved in the Self-Assessment,
 no fully-qualified Industrial Data Space certificate is handed out to
 the participant. The Self-Assessment leads only to a digital X.509
 certificate in order to facilitate participation in the Industrial
 Data Space. Nevertheless, it is a possibility for a prospective
 participant to explore and test the features of the Industrial Data
 Space in selected use cases. Another scenario for this layer is the
 use of a managed connector. It is operated by a fully evaluated
 service provider and the Self-Assessment would be only a low entry
 barrier for an end-user of such a managed connector.

#### Management System

 The evaluation of the participant's Management System is the next
 layer of evaluation depth. This evaluation is performed by an
 independent evaluation facility and involves analyzing whether the
 applicant has defined a management system and whether the applicant is
 actively working according to the defined management system. This
 layer of evaluation depth usually involves interviews, site audits and
 exemplary review of information and evidence at a certain point in
 time.

#### Control Framework

 The deepest layer of evaluation is the analysis of the Control
 Framework. This evaluation contains not only the review of the
 management system but also the evaluation of the operational
 effectiveness of the management system and the controls defined within
 the control framework of the applicant. This usually involves
 interviews, site audits and evidence gathering activities based on
 randomized sampling

 to demonstrate that controls were performed over a certain period of
 time. As with a Management System evaluation, the results are then
 approved by the Certification Body.

## Security Requirement Extent

 The extent of the Security Requirements consists of the following
 three levels and all levels are built on one another containing
 requirements derived from ISO/IEC 27001¹.

#### Entry Level

 The entry level covers only the basic security requirements that
 every participant of the Industrial Data Space needs to fulfill. The
 entry level serves as a low barrier for companies (especially SMEs)
 interested in trying out Industrial Data Space participation,
 without facing considerable up-front investments. With that in mind,
 this level is only combined with the low-cost self-assessment and an
 evaluation of the participant's Management System.

#### Member Level

 The member level additionally covers all relevant security
 requirements ensuring an advanced level of security, suitable for most
 of the core participants as defined in the Business Layer of the IDS
 Reference Architecture Model [IDSRA, 3.1]: Data Owner, Data
 Provider, Data Consumer, Broker Service Provider, App Store Provider,
 Vocabulary Provider, Service Provider. The member level is sufficient
 for most use cases involving the exchange of sensitive data.

#### Central Level

 Finally, the central level includes special requirements that are
 necessary for Industrial Data Space participants intending to perform
 key functionalities and roles within the Industrial Data Space. These
 requirements are appropriate since these roles have special
 responsibilities so any security breaches would risk affecting the
 Industrial Data Space as a whole, or substantial parts of it.
 Concretely, this applies to the following roles defined in the
 Business

 ¹For more information see
 ht[tps://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-](http://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-)
 information-security.html

 Layer of the IDS Reference Architecture Model [IDS- RA, 3.1]:
 Clearing House and Identity Provider.

 This distinction of the full qualified Industrial Data Space
 participants in a member level and a central level have been designed
 in order to have lower financial and procedural accession criteria.

 These two dimensions form a matrix with nine fields as shown in Figure
 4, and each field represents a combination of Evaluation Depth and the
 extent of the Security Requirements. This matrix is used by the data
 owner to define the degree of security that needs to be provided by
 other participating organizations in order for them to be allowed to
 obtain and process the owner's data. Due to this flexible
 certification approach, the data owner is enabled to

 specifically tailor their certification based on their business'
 requirements and capabilities. In addition, other participants
 benefit from using the matrix. For example, a new participant
 benefits from a low entry barrier by getting a certificate for entry
 level and self-assessment. After this, the participant can
 continuously develop in any direction of the matrix in order to
 facilitate a cooperation with other participants. This flexibility is
 especially helpful for start-ups and SMEs. On the other hand, the matrix enables certificates with a rate of security high enough to be
 sufficient even for large companies or those with strict security
 requirements. Each participant is therefore enabled to decide the
 required rate of security for the exchange of data, e.g. entry level
 for weather data, but member level coupled with Management System for
 sensitive business data.

 Figure 4: Certification Approach for participants of the Industrial
 Data Space

## Certification Criteria Catalogue

 To further reduce the financial entry barrier for Industrial Data
 Space applicants, the participant certification approach is designed
 to allow the re- use of existing certificates obtained through compliance with other certification schemes, standards, and norms. Depending
 on the desired level and depth of the evaluation, this could for
 example imply that certain control testing can be inherited from an
 ISAE3000 certification framework.

 In order to enable the participants to reuse their existing
 certificates, the participant certification criteria catalogue
 [CRIT-\] has been developed on the basis of established security
 standards. Due to the nature of the Industrial Data Space and its
 inter- national approach the standards ISO/ IEC 27001 and BSI C5²
 (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnologie (engl.
 Federal Office for Information Security) Cloud Computing Compliance
 Controls Catalogue) have been chosen. The standard ISO/ IEC 27001 has
 been chosen due to its international distribution and its reputation
 for information security. The standard BSI C5 is a standard for
 information security and developed for modern IT environments like
 cloud computing.

 ² For more information see
 ht[tps://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/](http://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/)
 Themen/DigitaleGesellschaft/CloudComputing/Anforderungs-
 katalog/Anforderungskatalog_node.html

 Out of both standards the requirements relevant for the Industrial
 Data Space have been selected for their applicability regarding the
 different levels. These requirements have been grouped in 16 sections with a different number of requirements for each level. Due to
 the incremental approach of the level all requirements of the entry
 level are also relevant for the member and central level and all
 requirements of the member level are also relevant for the central
 level.

## Piloting of Certification Criteria

 In order to verify the completeness, applicability, feasibility and
 relevance of the catalogue of certification criteria for the IDS
 participant certification, as well as the certification process for
 participants, piloting workshops with various IDSA members (e.g.
 GESIS, Komsa, Thyssenkrupp) were conducted. The workshops were
 organized by the WG Certification, bringing together experts in
 participant certification from the Working Group with the security
 officer and

 / or the compliance officer from the companies. In addition to the
 audit readiness, this validation gave valuable feedback for the list
 of certification requirements and the associated questionnaire.

 These 1-day workshops led by the expert from the Working Group were
 organized as a health check. The certification expert explained the
 certification process in detail. In a second phase the audit readiness was evaluated by going through the catalogue step by step. No
 documented evidence was required, only verbal information was
 collected. This approach enabled all parties to get a better sense of
 the status of the IDS-readiness for the participant, as well as the
 significance of each criteria. The results of the workshop were
 recorded by the evaluation lead and distributed to the company. The
 anonymized results were reported back to the WG Certification.

 In regard to the completeness and applicability of the criteria
 themselves, the in-depth discussion during the workshops in some cases
 led to an adjustment of the wording of a criterion. In addition the
 feedback of the piloting led to a new entry in the dimension matrix of
 Evaluation Depth and the Extent of the Security Requirements for
 participant certification (Member Level, Management System).

## Participants Overview

 This chapter summarizes the description of the architectural roles of
 the Industrial Data Space participants as defined in [IDSRA, 3.1]
 and how the participant certification applies to them.

#### Core Participants

 The Data Provider is responsible for the integrity, confidentiality,
 and availability of the data it publishes and provides. Evaluation
 and certification of the security mechanisms employed by the data
 provider shall provide a sufficient degree of security against the
 risk of relevant security requirements (such as data integrity,
 confidentiality, or availability) being undermined by attacks.

 Data Owners are assumed to often act as a data provider at the same
 time. In the case of the data owner and the data provider being
 different entities (i.e., the data owner does not publish the data
 itself but hands over this task to a data provider), both the data
 owner and the data provider are responsible for integrity and
 confidentiality of the data. Responsibility for the availability of
 the data, however, rests solely with the data provider in this case,
 provided

 the data owner has handed over the data to the data provider.

 For a data owner not acting as a data provider, evaluation and
 certification of the technical, physical, and organizational
 security mechanisms employed provide a sufficient degree of security
 against the risk of data integrity or confidentiality being undermined
 by attacks.

 As an organization that has access to data provided by a data owner,
 the Data Consumer also assumes responsibility for the confidentiality
 and integrity of that data (i.e., in terms of making sure the data
 can- not leave the Industrial Data Space in an uncontrol- led manner
 and cannot be corrupted before being used). Furthermore, the data
 consumer has to make sure the data cannot be used for purposes other
 than permitted. Against all these risks, evaluation and certification
 of the technical, physical, and organizational security mechanisms
 employed by the data consumer provide a sufficient degree of security.

#### Intermediaries

 Since preventing sensitive data from ending up in the wrong hands is a
 central goal of the Industrial Data Space initiative, it is highly
 critical to eliminate all risks involving manipulation of
 identities. The integrity and availability of identity-related
 information processed by the Identity Provider is therefore of utmost
 importance. Only evaluation and certification of the security
 mechanisms employed by the respective organization (in combination
 with technical security measures in relation with the software
 components used for processing identity-related information) is able
 to provide a sufficient degree of security against these risks.

 Broker Service Providers, providers of Clearing House services, the
 App Store Provider, and the Vocabulary Provider deal only with
 metadata, transactions, or apps (i.e., they do not work with the
 sensitive payload data which the Industrial Data Space is designed to
 protect). The risk associated with possible breaches of
 confidentiality, integrity, and availability of metadata is lower
 (with the exception of clearing house transaction data, which,
 however, lies beyond the scope of the Industrial Data Space).
 Nevertheless, an attacker succeeding in exfiltrating or corrupting
 metadata, or impeding

 the availability of metadata, would be able to cause considerable
 damage to the Industrial Data Space or targeted participants --
 especially if such successful attacks would remain undetected over
 extended periods of time. Therefore, evaluation and certification
 tailored to the specific risk profiles of and security mechanisms
 employed by broker service providers, providers of clearing house
 services, app store providers, and vocabulary providers is pro- posed
 in order to ensure a sufficient degree of security against the risks
 mentioned. As far as the app store provider is concerned, there is an
 additional risk in terms of an attacker successfully substituting
 legitimate apps with modified versions, thereby threatening the
 payload data indirectly. However, technical measures in the app store
 implementation (e.g., only apps cryptographically signed by the app
 developer are accepted and distributed) seem more effective for
 reducing this risk than organizational measures on the part of the app
 store provider.

####  Software / Service Providers

 Providers of compliant software usually have no contact with sensitive
 data, but execute tests with appropriate, non-sensitive test data.
 Therefore, in most cases no certification of the organizational
 security is required. If access to actual data of the Industrial Data
 Space is necessary, the Software Provider assumes the role of data
 consumer or data provider for as long as such access is needed. In
 that case, the certification requirements of the corresponding roles
 apply.

 If a participant does not deploy the technical infra- structure
 required to participate in the Industrial Data Space itself, it can
 outsource certain tasks, like publishing their data in the Industrial
 Data Space to a Service Provider hosting the required infrastructure.
 If this is the case, this Service Provider assumes the role of a Data
 Provider, Data Consumer, Broker Ser- vice Provider, etc. and performs
 the corresponding activities. They inherit the original role's
 responsibilities and risks, and shall therefore be subject to the
 corresponding requirements regarding certification.

 **PART 3 --** CORE COMPONENTS CERTIFICATION

 To secure the intended cross-industrial and cross-company information
 exchange, the Indus- trial Data Space core components must provide the
 required functionality and an appropriate level of security. As such,
 the core component certification is interoperability- and
 security-focused, while aiming to strengthen the development and
 maintenance process of these components.

 Similar to the participant certification, a matrix certification
 approach as shown in Figure 5 was defined for the core components of
 the Industrial Data Space. This ensures on the one hand a low entry
 barrier specifically suitable for SMEs and on the other hand a
 scalable certification to meet high information security
 requirements.

 Figure 5: Certification Approach for core components of the Industrial
 Data Space

## Assurance Levels

 The depth and rigor of an evaluation consists of the following three
 assurance levels as defined by the Industrial Data Space certification
 scheme:

#### Checklist Approach

 The core component must fulfill security features (security
 requirements, security properties, security functions) as defined by
 the corresponding checklist. The vendor of the component validates the
 claims made about the implementation. Additionally, an automated test
 suite will be used to verify the component's security features.

#### Concept Review

 Instead of the checklist approach, an in-depth re- view by an
 Industrial Data Space evaluation facility is necessary. The review
 includes an evaluation of the provided concept as well as practical
 functional and security tests.

#### High Assurance Evaluation

 For the third level, in addition to the functional and security tests,
 the vendor must provide the source code of all security relevant
 components and an in- depth source code review will be performed by an
 evaluation facility. Furthermore, the development process will be
 evaluated, including an audit of the development site.

##  Security Profiles

 Whenever two components establish a communication channel, it's up
 to them to decide which information they will send to the
 communication partner. Therefore, the identity and certification level
 (for both the participant and the component) must be provided by each
 component in the form of a digital certificate containing this
 information. As with the participant certification, this approach
 enables the data owner and data consumer to specify the security
 profile required for the core components used during data exchange.

 For this purpose, the Industrial Data Space certification scheme
 defines three security profiles for the core components defined in the
 section Component Overview of this paper.

#### Base Security Profile

 This profile includes basic security requirements: limited isolation
 of software components, secure communication including encryption and
 integrity protection, mutual authentication between components, as
 well as basic access control and logging. However, neither the
 protection of security related data (key material, certificates) nor
 trust verification are required. Persistent data is not encrypted and
 integrity protection for containers is not provided. This security
 profile is therefore meant for communication inside of a single
 security domain.

#### Trust Security Profile

 This profile includes strict isolation of software components
 (apps/services), secure storage of crypto- graphic keys in an isolated
 environment, secure communication including encryption, authentication and integrity protection, access and resource control, usage
 control and trusted update mechanisms. All data stored on persistent
 media or trans- mitted via networks must be encrypted.

#### Trust+ Security Profile

 This profile requires hardware based trust anchors (in the form of a
 TPM or a hardware-backed isolation environment) and supports remote
 integrity verification (i.e., remote attestation). All key material
 is stored in dedicated hardware isolated areas.

##  Certification Criteria Catalogue

 The catalogue of certification criteria for the IDS core components
 [CRIT-C] was defined as part of the Fraunhofer research project
 »Industrial Data Space« and fine-tuned with the members of the WG Certification. The catalogue is split into three thematic sections, i.e.
 IDS-specific requirements, functional requirements taken from the
 industry standard ISA/ IEC 62443-4-2 [62443-4-2] and best practice
 requirements for secure software development.

 Figure 6: Criteria Synergy

 Each criteria section targets a set of evaluation goals:

-   The IDS-specific requirements aim to evaluate the Core
    Component's conformity to the IDS Reference Architecture Model,
    both in regard to functionality (e.g. support of the IDS information
    model) as well as security (e.g. conformance to the IDS security
    architecture).

-   The requirements taken from ISA/IEC 62443-4-2 target the implemented
    functionality and security measures in relation to industry-wide
    accepted requirements for industrial automation and control
    systems, e.g. the capability to obscure feedback of authentication
    information during the authentication process.

-   To round off the catalogue, the best practice requirements for
    secure software development aim to evaluate the security of the
    processes during the development of the component, e.g. design
    documentation, physical security measures and test processes.

 To reduce the financial entry barrier not only for Industrial Data
 Space participants but also for the developers of core components, the
 component certification approach is designed to use existing certification schemes whenever reasonable. Where such certification
 schemes do not exist or aren't widely recognized, e.g., for
 Industrial Data Space-specific aspects, criteria defined within the
 Industrial Data Space certification scheme will be employed.

 The functional and security requirements of the core components to be
 evaluated will be defined based on the IDS Reference Architecture
 Model, specific component specifications like the Connector Specification as well as widely recognized requirement catalogues like
 ISA/IEC 62443-4-2 (e.g. for functional requirements such as data
 confidentiality and system integrity).

 The evaluation at the various assurance levels can also be supported
 and facilitated by requiring appropriate measures used throughout the
 lifecycle of the component as defined in ISA/IEC 62443-4-2, such as
 using the approach for thorough elicitation of the Security
 Requirements, enforcing those Security Requirements at the
 Architecture level (e.g., using Security-by-Design) and tracing them
 to the

 Secure Implementation level, supported by relevant Guidance
 Documents, Verification & Validation approaches, as well as a Secure
 Defect Management & Secure Update Management.³

## Piloting of Certification Criteria

 In order to verify the completeness and applicability of the
 catalogue of certification criteria for the IDS core component
 »Connector« to real-world implementations, as well as the
 IDS-readiness of these implementations, piloting workshops with
 various IDSA members (e.g. Fraunhofer AISEC, T-Systems, Cybus) were
 conducted. The workshops were organized by the WG Certification,
 bringing together Fraunhofer IDS certification experts, developers and
 product owners. While Fraunhofer had the best knowledge about
 certification requirements, the developers and product owners
 (consisting at least of the project manager and lead developer)
 brought their in-depth knowledge about real-world implementations of
 connector components as well as a business/market perspective to the
 table.

 During these 2-day workshops led by Fraunhofer FOKUS, the Connector
 implementation was evaluated by going through the catalogue step by
 step and looking into the implemented measures meeting the
 requirements as well as the existing developer documentation. This
 approach enabled all parties to get a better sense of the status of
 the IDS-readiness of the implementation under evaluation. The results
 of the workshop were recorded by the evaluation lead and distributed
 to the developer. The anonymized results were reported back to the WG
 Certification.

 In regard to the completeness and applicability of the requirements
 themselves, the in-depth discussions during the workshops in some
 cases led to an adjustment of the wording of a requirement, the
 addition of new requirements or the removal of non-applicable
 requirements (either entirely or for a specific Security Profile). As
 such, each piloting workshop led to a new version of the requirements
 catalogue.

## Component Overview

 This chapter summarizes the Industrial Data Space core components as
 assessed in [IDSRA, 4.2] that are targets of the component
 certification.

#### Connector

 Being the point of access to the Industrial Data Space, the Connector
 provides a controlled environment for processing and exchanging
 data, ensuring secure transfer of data from the data provider to the
 data consumer. As such, the necessary trust in the correct and
 complete implementation of the functionality required by the IDS
 Reference Architecture Model and the Connector specification can only
 be ensured by independent evaluation and certification from an
 approved evaluation facility and the certification body of the
 Industrial Data Space.

#### Broker

 A Broker service does not have access to primary data, but only to
 metadata provided by data providers, which is generally considered
 less sensitive. Likewise, Broker services do not assign or enforce
 access rights, but merely support data exchange. Nevertheless,
 integrity and availability of metadata (i.e., correct and secure
 storing and handling of meta- data) is of high importance for the
 Industrial Data Space. Compatibility with the required functionality
 as defined by the certification body is therefore evaluated and
 certified.

#### Apps and Services

 Data Apps and Services have direct contact with primary data, which
 means that a compromised Data App or Service may compromise the integrity of data. However, confidentiality and availability of data is
 ensured by the measures defined in the Security Architecture of the
 Industrial Data Space, which strongly limit the potential damage
 caused by

 Data Apps and Services. Also, Apps and Services will typically use the
 security features provided by the Connector. Therefore, not every Data
 App or Service to be made available in the Industrial Data Space
 requires a medium or high assurance level certification. However,
 the automated test suite mentioned above for the basic security
 level will be integrated in the upload process of each Industrial
 Data Space App Store.

#### App Store

 While the App Store itself does not have direct contact with primary
 data, the Apps and Services they provide do. Compromised security of
 the App Store, particularly of the test suite used during app and
 service upload, could lead to the circulation of compromised Apps and
 Services. Compatibility with the required functionality and security
 features is therefore to be evaluated and certified.

#### Hardware

 For certain security profiles as defined in the IDS Reference
 Architecture Model, additional hardware security components are
 required to achieve an appropriate level of protection for access to
 sensitive data. In addition to the core software components of the
 Industrial Data Space, these hardware components must therefore also
 be considered in the context of certification. In the interest of
 trust- worthiness, and to avoid double certification, the use of
 third-party certified hardware components will be required (e.g.,
 Trusted Platform Modules certified in accordance with the Protection
 Profiles BSI- CC-PP-0030-2008 or ANSSI-CC-PP-2015/07). Certification activities of the Industrial Data Space regarding these
 components will be limited to checking the validity of existing base
 certificates.

 **PART 4 --** HOW-TO: IDS CERTIFICATION PROCESS

 Participants and core components within the IDS ecosystem shall
 provide sufficiently high degree of security regarding the integrity
 and confidentiality of the data being processed in the IDS. Therefore,
 a certification of participants and core components is mandatory.
 Involved partners are the applicant, evaluation facility and the
 certification body. The certification process is divided into the
 following three phases:

## Application Stage

 The main goal of this stage is the successful start of the IDS
 certification process.

-   The certification process for any applicant starts with the
    applicant triggering the certification process.

-   Before this, an optional consultation can take place between the
    applicant and the evaluation facility or the applicant and the
    certification body. Possible topics are for example: Presentation
    of test competence and test procedure of the evaluation facility or
    advice on IDS certification process and certification criteria
    from the certification body. Especially for new participants or
    manufacturers this consultation is highly recommended.

-   The applicant must contact an approved evaluation facility to
    carry out the evaluation according to the IDS certification schema.
    The choice of the evaluation facility lies with the applicant.

-   The applicant must apply for certification to trigger the start of
    the certification process.

-   The applicant must provide the necessary evidence for the
    certification body to confirm the application. This includes, for
    example, the following documents: company profile, list of cur-
    rent certificates, detailed information of the pre- sent changes in
    case of recertification.

-   This confirmation by the certification body may result in a
    rejection of the application. In this case, the certification
    process ends at this point and there is no review by the evaluation
    facility or the issue of a certificate.

-   If the application is accepted, the evaluation procedure will be
    opened and there will be a Kick-Off with all involved partners
    (applicant, evaluation facility, certification body).

 For the next phase (evaluation stage), the applicant must provide the
 necessary documents and, in case of the certification of a core
 component certification, also the component with the necessary
 associated documentation, to the evaluation facility and the
 certification body.

## Evaluation Stage

 The main goal of this stage is the evaluation of a participant or IDS
 core component based on the defined certification criteria. If
 necessary, corrective actions need to be per- formed by the applicant
 to achieve a successful certification. The parties mainly involved
 at this stage are the applicant and evaluation facility; it includes
 the following steps:

-   The evaluation facility is responsible for carrying out the detailed
    technical and/or organizational evaluation work during the
    certification. The basis for the evaluation is either the
    certification criteria catalog for the participant certification or
    the criteria catalog for the component. This includes the execution
    of all necessary tests and on-site checks, with the details
    depending on the chosen certification level.

-   The evaluation facility documents the detailed results in an
    evaluation report. The recipients of this report are the applicant
    and the certification body.

-   If deviations have been identified, corrective actions will be
    defined. Implementing these corrective actions is the responsibility
    of the applicant. Afterwards, a re-examination is necessary. A
    renewed on-site check is only required for serious defects, i.e.
    in cases where the rectification can only be checked on-site.

-   The evaluation is monitored by the certification body to ensure the
    correct implementation and execution of the IDS certification
    scheme. This can include the accompaniment of the evaluation
    facility during an on-site check.

 The result of this stage is the evaluation report, created by the
 evaluation facility. The report serves the certification body in the
 next stage as a basis for the decision-making for the approval of the
 certificate.

## Certification Stage

 The main topics of this stage are the examination of the evaluation
 report by the certification body as well as the processes for issuing
 the certificate if the result is positive. The parties applicant and
 certification body are mainly involved at this stage; it includes the
 following steps:

-   The certification body receives the evaluation report from the
    evaluation facility and is responsible for the final decision about
    the award or denial of the certificate. If corrective actions and
    re-examination are required, updated evaluation reports will be
    provided.

-   The decision may be that no certificate can be issued. In this case,
    the procedure is terminated and the applicant receives a rejection
    notice.

-   If the decision is positive, the applicant will be confirmed as
    being IDS compliant. The certification body issues the certificate,
    triggers the generation of a X.509 certificate and publishes the
    certificate and the certification report online.

-   The certification body archives the procedural documents.

-   The applicant is responsible for archiving the evidence
    documentation as used during the evaluation.

-   Independent of the final decision by the certification body
    (acceptance or rejection), an invoice will be send to the applicant
    by the evaluation facility and the certification body.

 **PART 5 --** FUTURE WORK

 After having finalized version 1 of the Certification Criteria
 Catalogues for IDS Participants and Core Components, the Working Group
 will focus next on the Criteria Catalogue for IDS Evaluation
 Facilities.

 It is foreseen that the IDS Certification Body, on top of being
 monitored by the IDSA, will be accredited by the national
 accreditation body (e.g., DAkkS in Germany) in the future. Its
 responsibilities in the context of the IDS Certification Scheme will
 include:

-   Auditing the Certification Body to verify, for example, their
    adherence to regulatory and normative requirements4.

-   Provisioning of recommendations to the Certification Body based on
    the results of its monito- ring activities.

 The Accreditation Body will be a nationally unique entity, supervising
 the nations certificate-gran- ting institutions. It will not be
 actively involved in a participant or core component certification and
 the approval of Evaluation Facilities for performing Industrial Data
 Space evaluations.
