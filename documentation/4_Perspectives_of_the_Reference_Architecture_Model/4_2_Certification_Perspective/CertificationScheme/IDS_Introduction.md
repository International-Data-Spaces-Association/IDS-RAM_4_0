# INTRODUCTION

 The Industrial Data Space is a virtual data space leveraging existing
 standards and technologies, as well as accepted governance models, to
 facilitate the secure exchange and easy linkage of data in a trusted
 business ecosystem. The Industrial Data Space is an initiative that is
 institutionalized by two main activities: the Fraunhofer research pro-
 jects »Industrial Data Space« and »Industrial Data Space Plus« as well
 as the »International Data Spaces Association«. While the research
 projects are concerned with the design and implementation of the
 Reference Architecture Model, the IDSA unites the requirements from
 various industries and pro- vides use cases to test the results gained
 from its implementation.

 Data security and data sovereignty are the fundamental
 characteristics of the Industrial Data Space. Data sovereignty is a
 natural person's or legal entity's capability of exclusive
 self-determination with regard to their data goods. Participants
 within the Industrial Data Space must therefore use certified software
 (e.g., the »Industrial Data

 Space Connector«) in order to securely exchange data in a sovereign
 way. Furthermore, data is only ex- changed if the exchange takes place
 between trust- worthy and certified participants. This document
 therefore presents the approach to participant and core component
 certification within the Industrial Data Space.

 The Industrial Data Space certification scheme encompasses all
 processes, rules and standards governing the certification of
 participants and core components within the Industrial Data Space. The
 purpose of this document is therefore to present the framework for the
 scheme's structure, processes, evaluation levels and criteria
 catalogues as defined by the Working Group Certification of the
 International Data Spaces Association. As such, this paper illustrates
 the core of our ambition for crafting a flexible and cost-effective
 certification scheme. As this is a work in progress, adjustments to
 the certification scheme may be made in the future and published in
 updated versions of this document.
