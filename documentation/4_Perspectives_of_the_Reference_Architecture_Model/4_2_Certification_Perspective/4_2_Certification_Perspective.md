# Certification Perspective

[TODO:revise]

Data security and data sovereignty are the fundamental value propositions of the International Data Spaces. Data sovereignty can be defined as a natural person's or legal entity's capability of being in full control of its data. To enable this control, each participant needs to follow the agree rules for the IDS and requires reliable information about the guarantees offered by potential business partners.
Therefore, any organization or individual seeking permission to operate components in the International Data Spaces needs to pass the Operational Environment Certification ensuring secure processes and management of components.


 certified, and so are the core software components (e.g., the IDS Connector) the participants use to securely exchange data with one another While the certification of organizations and individuals focuses on security and trust, the certification of components also refers to compliance with technical requirements ensuring interoperability.

To ensure a consistent process in the certification of participants and core components, the IDS uses a Certification Scheme comprising all processes, rules, and standards governing the certification process. The IDS Certification Scheme follows best practices from other, internationally accredited certification concepts.
