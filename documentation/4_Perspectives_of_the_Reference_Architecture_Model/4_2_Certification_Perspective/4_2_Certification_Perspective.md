# Certification Perspective

[TODO:revise]

Data security and data sovereignty are the fundamental value
propositions of the International Data Spaces. Data sovereignty can be
defined as a natural person's or legal entity's capability of being in
full control of its data. Therefore, any organization or individual
seeking permission to access the International Data Spaces is certified,
and so are the core software components (e.g., the IDS Connector) the
participants use to securely exchange data with one another While the
certification of organizations and individuals focuses on security and
trust, the certification of components also refers to compliance with
technical requirements ensuring interoperability.

To ensure a consistent process in the certification of participants and
core components, the IDS uses a Certification Scheme comprising all
processes, rules, and standards governing the certification process. The
IDS Certification Scheme follows best practices from other,
internationally accredited certification concepts.
