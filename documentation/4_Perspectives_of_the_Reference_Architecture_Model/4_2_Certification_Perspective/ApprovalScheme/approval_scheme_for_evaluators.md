# "IDS Certification: Approval Scheme for Evaluation Facilities"


# Introduction

  In principle, an evaluation facility can only carry out expert
  evaluations for the IDS if it has been approved by the IDS
  certification body. As such, the information in this document is
  addressed at organizations that have decided to start the approval
  process.

  This document defines the rules (areas of application, required
  evidence) as well as the approval steps. These rules and processes are
  in part based on the approval scheme of the BSI for Common Criteria
  evaluation facilities [BSI_CC_EF-Approval]. The specific
  requirements for IDS evaluation facilities as defined in [17025-
  Criteria] are based on DIN EN ISO/IEC 17025 [17025], in order to
  facilitate an eventual accreditation of the IDS certification scheme
  by national accreditation bodies.

  The approval of an organization as an IDS evaluation facility is
  carried out at the instigation of the owner or company management of
  the organization. Approval is granted to organizations operated by
  natural or legal persons under civil law.

  Approval as an evaluation facility takes place when it has been
  established that all requirements for the area of application applied
  for (i.e. component or participant certification) have been met (see
  Chapter Approval Phase). As a rule, at least two professionally
  qualified employees per area of application applied for must be named
  by the applying organization.

# Approval Scheme

  The approval scheme for evaluation facilities documented in this
  chapter describes the respective areas of application for the
  evaluation facilities in the International Data Spaces certification
  scheme. Specifically, it is possible to be approved as an evaluation
  facility for Participant Certification and/or Component certification.

  The evaluation facilities shall comply with the requirements of the
  criteria catalogue based on the DIN EN ISO/ IEC 17025 list
  [17025-Criteria-IDS] <Footnote 1> , the requirements of the
  Participant Certification Criteria Catalogue, Member Level [ISMS
  Requirements] <Footnote 2>  of the International Data Spaces as well
  as have the necessary expertise in the relevant area of application.

  An evaluation facility shall employ at least two persons whose
  competence has been verified by the International Data Spaces
  Certification Body. Evaluations may only be carried out by evaluators
  whose professional competence has been established in the context of a
  competence assessment (see Chapter Competence Assessment) by the
  International Data Spaces Certification Body.

  In the interest of competition, the long-term objective is to have
  more than one active, approved evaluation facility per area of
  application, so that component developers and participants can
  exercise their contractual freedom in this respect.

## Benefits of Approval as an IDS Evaluation Facility

  In order to carry out an IDS certification, the applicant requires an
  evaluation facility that performs the evaluation of the participant or
  component to be certified. The evaluation facility is selected by the
  applicant and commissioned (generally at the applicant's expense). An
  evaluation facility can only carry out evaluations within the IDS
  certification scheme if it has been approved as an expert body by the
  IDS certification body.

  Approved evaluation facilities play an active role in strengthening
  the security and interoperability of the International Data Spaces and
  are the only companies entitled to carry out evaluations within the
  certification scheme.

  By subjecting the trustworthiness and competence of the IDS evaluation
  facilities to an initial check and subsequent continuous monitoring,
  the validity and worth of the certificates issued within the IDS for
  participants and components is ensured.

## Areas of Application

  The IDS approval scheme covers the areas of participant evaluation and
  component evaluation.

  The participant evaluations to be performed for the International Data
  Spaces serve the purpose of proving the trustworthiness of
  participating organizations by evaluating their fulfillment of a set
  of technical as well as

  procedural requirements documented in the corresponding criteria
  catalog. For the participant, the certificate is the most essential
  prerequisite for gaining access to International Data Spaces.

  The component evaluations to be performed for the International Data
  Spaces serve the purpose of proving the trustworthiness of developed
  components by evaluating their fulfillment of a set of functional and
  security requirements documented in the corresponding criteria
  catalog. The certificate is the most essential access requirement for
  the use of a specific component implementation in the International
  Data Spaces.

  This responsible evaluation must be carried out by an evaluation
  facility that has the necessary technical competence (and, in the case
  of component certification, testing equipment) and is demonstrably
  trustworthy. This is ensured and continuously monitored as part of a
  two-stage approval process.

  During initial approval, the evaluation facility shall prove their
  professional competence in the selected field(s) of application and
  additionally conduct a successful trial evaluation of a participating
  organization or component, while being monitored by the certification
  body. All designated evaluators shall play an equally active role in
  this trial evaluation.<Footnote 3>

  The competencies to be demonstrated for the area of participant
  certification depend on the evaluation level of the examinations to be
  carried out by the evaluation facility (i.e. Management System and/or
  Control Framework).

  The competencies to be demonstrated for the area of component
  certification depend on the evaluation level of the examinations to be
  carried out by the evaluation facility (i.e. Checklist Approach,
  Concept Review and/or High Assurance Evaluation).

# Approval Process

## Necessary Documents for Application

  Necessary documents to apply for approval are:

-   Company portrait during initial approval,

-   Current extract from the trade, cooperative, association or
    partnership register (no older than 6 months). In addition to the
    ownership structure, investment relations must also be disclosed,

-   Self-insurance that the company is not in insolvency or liquidation,
    that no insolvency proceedings have been instituted against the
    company or that the company is not in a comparable situation or is
    threatened with such a situation,

-   List of all relevant employees of the evaluation facility with
    project and work history for the area of application(s) as well as
    their competence profiles.

  Quality management system according to ISO/IEC 17025 [17025,
  17025-Criteria-IDS]

-   System documentation of a quality management system according to
    ISO/IEC 17025 related to the area of application applied for.

-   Personnel records stating responsibilities and powers.

-   A written statement on all relevant individual aspects of [17025-
    Criteria-IDS] with information on the measures by which the
    applicant fulfills the individual aspects of the requirements
    catalogue and where in the QM documentation the respective measures
    are documented. The catalogue [17025-Criteria-IDS] is made available
    for free by the International Data Spaces
    certification body and shall be sent back to the certification body
    for further processing in electronic, editable form.

-   [Extension of the mentions of ISO/IEC 17025 in the paragraph to]:
    ISO/IEC 17025 or an equivalent, relevant standard

-   As an alternative for the documentation and statements regarding a
    quality management system, the Certification Body recognizes an
    existing certification according to ISO/IEC 17025 or an equivalent,
    relevant standard.

-   As an alternative for the documentation and statements regarding a
    quality management system, the Certification Body recognizes
    relevant accreditations for the Evaluation Facility as a
    certification body for schemes underlying the IDS certification,
    such as ISO/ IEC 27001 or ISO/IEC 17025. The respective
    accreditation must have been conducted by an accreditation body,
    which is part of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF).

  Information Security Management

-   System documentation of the information security management system
    (incl. network topology).

-   A written statement on all individual aspects of physical and
    organizational security (incl. plan of site), defined in the

  criteria catalogue for Participant Certification, Member Level
  [ISMS_Requirements] or an equivalent, relevant standard, including
  information on what actions the applicant has taken to meet the
  individual aspects of the requirements and where the actions are
  documented in the ISMS documentation.

-   As an alternative for the documentation and statements regarding
    Information Security Management, the Certification Body recognizes
    an existing certification according to ISO/IEC 27001 or an
    equivalent, relevant standard.

-   As an alternative for the documentation and statements regarding
    Information Security Management, the Certification Body recognizes
    relevant accreditations for the Evaluation Facility as

  a certification body for schemes underlying the IDS certification,
  such as ISO/IEC 27001 or ISO/IEC 17025. The respective accreditation
  must have been conducted by an accreditation body, which is part of
  the International Accreditation Forum (IAF).

  In addition to the documents and evidence mentioned above, at least
  two experienced evaluators shall be list per area of application. The
  technical qualification of the designated evaluators must be
  demonstrated by the evaluation facility.

## System Audits and Technical Assessments

  Within the context of approval as an evaluation facility, regular
  system audits with a technical assessment are carried out by the IDS
  certification body. A system audit is carried out at least every two
  years.

  In principle, system audits can also be carried out occasion-related
  on a case-by-case basis if the certification body believes it is
  necessary. This can be the case, for example, with increased or
  recurring problems while performing evaluations.

  The focus of a system audit is on special technical requirements
  resulting from the respective area of application as well as
  requirements for the ISMS.

  A system audit may include the following steps:

-   Interviews with employees,

-   Competence assessment of the evaluation facility staff,

-   Assessment of the information security management system,

-   Assessment of the technical equipment (area of application:
    component certification),

-   Trial evaluation of a test object.

## Phases of the Approval Process

  The approval process for evaluation facilities is divided into the
  following three phases.

### Preparatory Phase

  Before submitting an application, an inquiry meeting with the IDS
  certification body is possible. The purpose of this meeting is to
  provide the applicant with an insight into the process, to select the
  area(s) of application and to discuss, among others, the topics of
  independence of the facility and application costs.

  A template for the application is made available on the IDSA website.
  Applications will be processed in the order in which they are
  received.

  On the basis of the documents submitted, an initial system analysis is
  carried out to determine whether the evidence submitted is sufficient
  to carry out the audit. In this document check, a comparison with the

  requirements relevant for the area(s) of application takes place. In
  the event of non-conformities, the applicant will be given the
  opportunity to rectify them.

  After a positive review of the documents, time schedules for the audit
  will be agreed in writing between applicant and certification body. In
  preparation, the applicant receives an audit plan.

  All participants in the procedure are obliged to inform the other
  participants of any deviations from the agreed time schedule.

  After an application has been processed with a negative result, the
  application is rejected by the certification body.

### Audit Phase

  During the audit phase, the certification body carries out an
  assessment consisting of the following parts:

-   assessment of the quality management system,

-   assessment of the information security management system and

-   assessment of the competence of the evaluators per area of
    application.

  The assessment is carried out to verify that the measures taken to
  meet the requirements are implemented and effective.

  After collecting the evidence through interviews with the employees,
  inspection of records and documents as well as other measures (e.g.
  inspection of technical systems), the audit findings (deviations and
  potential for improvement) are made. The applicant will be informed of
  these and the result of the audit in a final discussion.

  If deviations are found, a common understanding must be developed in
  the final discussion. The coordination and scheduling of corrective
  measures takes place in the final discussion or, if necessary, after a
  root cause analysis has been carried out.

  The result of the audit is summarized with a recommendation in an
  audit report.

  All deviations that call into question the effectiveness of the
  management system must be corrected before a positive audit
  conclusion. If necessary, the correction of the deviations can be
  verified by an additional audit.

### Approval Phase

  On the basis of the audit report, the certification body decides on
  the approval of the applicant. The decision is made in an objective
  and comprehensible manner, i.e. exclusively on the basis of the
  documented criteria.

  The certification body issues an approval statement after a positive
  decision has been made. The approval is limited in time; the
  limitation period is two years.

  A negative approval decision is made if no professional competence for
  the area(s) of application or no effective quality management system
  or information security management system could be demonstrated. In
  this case, the applicant is informed of the reasons for the rejection
  before the application is formally rejected. The applicant is given
  the opportunity to comment and apply corrective measures within a
  reasonable period of time according to the deviation. For critical
  deviations the maximum period is 2 months or longer in case of
  justified exceptions. Uncritical findings will have to be corrected
  until the re-approval audit at the latest.

  Within one month after notification of the decision, objections may be
  raised in writing. The applicant may waive the objection period in
  order to enable the approval to be published more quickly.

### Renewal of Approval (Re-Approval)

  Five months before the expiry of the approval, a request for
  re-approval is to be submitted in order to ensure that the approval
  continues without interruption.

  An assessment by means of a trial evaluation does not take place in
  the case of re-approval, if the evaluation facility has carried out at
  least one evaluation per area of application. During a renewal audit,
  the focus will be on the changes since the last audit.

  **Ad Hoc Approval**

  The assessment for an Ad Hoc Approval is necessary, when significant
  changes of the Evaluation Facility or of the IDS Certification
  Standards occur, which could have an impact on the given approval. The
  scenario for the Evaluation Facility includes e.g. changes regarding
  processes, persons, responsibilities, location or physical environment
  like laboratories. The scenario for the IDS Certification Standards

  includes major changes to the requirements catalogues or the
  certification procedure.

  Unlike the (Re-)Approval, the Ad Hoc Approval mainly consists of the
  check of documents prefilled by the Evaluation Facility which explain
  the significance of the changes and whether they affect the ability of
  the evaluation facility to conduct evaluations. The review of the
  documents is conducted by the Certification Body. Based on these
  documents, the

  Certification Body decides, if a more detailed audit is necessary
  because the validity of the approval is at risk. In this case, the
  next Reapproval would be moved forward.

### Restriction, Suspension or Withdrawal of Approval

-   The evaluation facility is obliged to inform the certification in
    detail without delay if it becomes aware that the requirements for
    an evaluation facility have not been or are no longer met.

-   If the certification body has reason to believe, that the
    requirements for an evaluation facility have not been or are no
    longer met, it

  shall immediately take the necessary measures to determine whether the
  requirements are met. The action for determination should be an Ad Hoc
  Approval Assessment to analyse the potential

  non-fulfilment of requirements. Based on this assessment, the
  Reapproval Assessment may be moved forward to allow a more thorough
  assessment, if the validity of the approval is at risk The
  certification body may suspend the approval for the duration of the
  necessary assessment. In the case of suspension, possible applicants
  shall be informed of the suspension.

-   The approval shall be withdrawn if the evaluation facility has not
    met or does no longer meet the requirements for evaluation
    facilities. This might either be the case if necessary prerequisites
    for the approval are not or no longer met or if the evaluation
    facility does not conduct the evaluations according to the
    specifications, e.g. by not following the required procedures or by
    lacking quality in the evaluation.

-   Evaluation reports by the affected Evaluation Facilities and
    certificates based on these reports facility should be (re-)assessed
    by the Certification Body to determine whether revocation,
    limitation or suspension of the certificate is necessary.

-   The permission for an Evaluation Facility to conduct evaluations is
    restricted during the approval phases in the following way. Before
    and during the process for the First Approval, no evaluation must be
    started or conducted. Before the process for the Reapproval, no
    restriction on the permission to evaluate applies. During the
    process for a Reapproval, evaluations can be conducted but it must
    be planned to finish the evaluations before the end of the current
    approval phase of two years. Before and during the process for the
    Ad Hoc Approval, no restriction on the permission to evaluate
    applies.

## Competence Assessment

  An International Data Spaces evaluation requires a certain level of
  expertise and specific qualifications from the evaluators. In order to
  guarantee a high level of quality in the procedures, the evaluators
  employed by the evaluation facilities shall meet minimum technical and
  personal requirements.

  The complexity and diversity of IT products and operational
  environments requires a high level of technical and product/system
  knowledge and of the relevant standards from the evaluation facility
  and the persons employed there for the evaluations. These framework
  conditions make it necessary to formulate minimum requirements for the
  evaluators of the facilities seeking approval.

  The requirements outlines in the following two sections shall already
  be met when presenting new evaluators to the certification body.

### Technical Requirements

-   Proof of at least 3 relevant references from the last 3 years

-   Basic knowledge of IT security.

-   Knowledge of the English languages.

-   Basic knowledge of project management.

-   Knowledge of the IDS certification process.

  In addition, the evaluators shall meet the following minimum
  requirements for the area of application component certification:

-   Knowledge of site security, network security and security management
    (e.g. ISO 27001 or IT- Grundschutz),

-   Tool knowledge (especially development tools, analysis and attack
    tools),

-   Experience in vulnerability analysis and penetration testing and

-   Basic knowledge of cryptography (from test depth Concept Review).

  For the area of application participant certification, additional
  requirements are:

-   Experience performing assessments according to ISO 27001,
    IT-Grundschutz or comparable standards.

### Personal Requirements

-   Analytical approach to projects.

-   Reliable.

-   Ability to deal with conflict.

-   Ability to work in a team.

## Framework Conditions for the Approval Process

  The applicant may withdraw the application for approval at any time
  during the process. In this case, the process will be terminated from
  the certification body. The costs and expenses incurred up to that
  point shall be charged by the certification body in accordance with
  the price list of the certification body.\<Footnote 4\

  The certification body may reject an application if the above
  requirements are not met or if an incomplete application for initial
  or re-approval is not completed within 3 months.

  In order to maintain approval, the evaluation facility shall comply
  with the following requirements:

-   The evaluation facility shall authorize and provide adequate support
    for periodic or ad hoc reviews to maintain approval. The costs shall
    be paid by the applicant.

-   The evaluation facility shall immediately notify the certification
    body in writing of any change in its operating procedures with
    regard to compliance, its legal form, its ownership and
    participation, or its registered office(s).

  The evaluation facility shall immediately notify the certification
  body in writing of any planned moves or relevant structural changes to
  the facilities premises.

-   Amendments to the rules and regulations that are relevant for the
    approval and will require an ad hoc review will only be made by the
    IDSA once a year.

-   As soon as an approved evaluation facility plans to move to new
    premises, the certification body must be informed of this intent. A
    suitability audit of the new premises must be carried out before the
    evaluation facility moves.

-   If an evaluation facility moves without the new premises being
    pre-audited, there shall be no approval of the evaluation facility
    in the new premises.

-   New staff to be employed within the area of application shall be
    notified to the certification body before taking up evaluation
    activities.

-   If an evaluator leaves the organization or is no longer active in
    IDS evaluations.
