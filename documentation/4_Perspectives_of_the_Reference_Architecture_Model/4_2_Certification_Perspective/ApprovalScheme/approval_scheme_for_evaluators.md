## Introduction
In principle, an Evaluation Facility can only carry out expert evaluations for the IDS if it has been approved by the IDS Certification Body.
As such, the information in this document is addressed at organizations that have decided to start the approval process.

This document defines the rules (areas of application, required evidence) as well as the approval steps.
These rules and processes are in part based on the approval scheme of the BSI for Common Criteria Evaluation Facilities [BSI_CC_EF-Approval].
The specific requirements for IDS Evaluation Facilities as defined in [17025-Criteria] are based on DIN EN ISO/IEC 17025 [17025], in order to facilitate an eventual accreditation of the IDS Certification Scheme by national accreditation bodies.

The approval of an organization as an IDS Evaluation Facility is carried out at the instigation of the owner or company management of the organization. Approval is granted to organizations operated by natural or legal persons under civil law.

Approval as an Evaluation Facility takes place when it has been established that all requirements for the area of application applied for (i.e. component or Operational Environment Certification) have been met (see Chapter Approval Phase).
As a rule, at least two professionally qualified employees per area of application applied for must be named by the applying organization.

## Approval Scheme
The approval scheme for Evaluation Facilities documented in this chapter describes the respective areas of application for the Evaluation Facilities in the International Data Spaces certification scheme.
Specifically, it is possible to be approved as an Evaluation Facility for Operational Environment Certification and/or Component Certification.

The Evaluation Facilities shall comply with the requirements of the criteria catalog based on the DIN EN ISO/ IEC 17025 list [17025-Criteria-IDS] <Footnote 1>, the requirements of the Operational Environment Certification Criteria Catalog, Trust Level 2 [ISMS Requirements] <Footnote 2> of the International Data Spaces as well as have the necessary expertise in the relevant area of application

An Evaluation Facility shall employ at least two persons whose competence has been verified by the International Data Spaces Certification Body.
Evaluations may only be carried out by evaluators whose professional competence has been established in the context of a competence assessment (see Chapter Competence Assessment) by the International Data Spaces Certification Body.

In the interest of competition, the long-term objective is to have more than one active, approved Evaluation Facility per area of application, so that component developers and participants can exercise their contractual freedom in this respect.

## Benefits of Approval as an IDS Evaluation Facility
In order to carry out an IDS Certification, the Applicant requires an Evaluation Facility that performs the evaluation of the operational environment or component to be certified. The Evaluation Facility is selected by the Applicant and commissioned (generally at the Applicant's expense).
An Evaluation Facility can only carry out evaluations within the IDS Certification Scheme if it has been approved as an expert body by the IDS Certification Body.

Approved Evaluation Facilities play an active role in strengthening the security and interoperability of the International Data Spaces and are the only companies entitled to carry out evaluations within the certification scheme.

By subjecting the trustworthiness and competence of the IDS Evaluation Facilities to an initial check and subsequent continuous monitoring, the validity and worth of the certificates issued within the IDS for operational environments and components is ensured.

## Areas of Application
The IDS approval scheme covers the areas of operational environment evaluation and component evaluation.

The operational environment evaluations to be performed for the International Data Spaces serve the purpose of proving the trustworthiness of participating organizations by evaluating their fulfillment of a set of technical as well as procedural requirements documented in the corresponding criteria catalog.
For the operational environment, the certificate is the most essential prerequisite for gaining access to International Data Spaces.

The component evaluations to be performed for the International Data Spaces serve the purpose of proving the trustworthiness of developed components by evaluating their fulfillment of a set of functional and security requirements documented in the corresponding criteria catalog.
The certificate is the most essential access requirement for the use of a specific component implementation in the International Data Spaces.

This responsible evaluation must be carried out by an Evaluation Facility that has the necessary technical competence (and, in the case of Component Certification, testing equipment) and is demonstrably trustworthy.
This is ensured and continuously monitored as part of a two-stage approval process.
During initial approval, the Evaluation Facility shall prove their professional competence in the selected field(s) of application and additionally conduct a successful trial evaluation of a participating organization or component, while being monitored by the Certification Body.
All designated evaluators shall play an equally active role in this trial evaluation.<Footnote 3>

Independent on the area of application, the competencies to be demonstrated for the area of Operational Environment Certification and Component Certification depend on the assurance level of the examinations to be carried out by the Evaluation Facility (i.e. Assurance Level 2 and/or Assurance Level 3).

## Approval Process

In addition to the documents and evidence mentioned above, at least two experienced evaluators shall be list per area of application.
The technical qualification of the designated evaluators must be demonstrated by the Evaluation Facility.

### System Audits and Technical Assessments
Within the context of approval as an Evaluation Facility, regular system audits with a technical assessment are carried out by the IDS Certification Body.
A system audit is carried out at least every two years.
In principle, system audits can also be carried out occasion-related on a case-by-case basis if the Certification Body believes it is necessary.
This can be the case, for example, with increased or recurring problems while performing evaluations.
The focus of a system audit is on special technical requirements resulting from the respective area of application as well as requirements for the ISMS.
A system audit may include the following steps:

- Interviews with employees,
- Competence assessment of the Evaluation Facility staff,
- Assessment of the information security management system,
- Assessment of the technical equipment (area of application:
 Component Certification),
- Trial evaluation of a test object.

| **Tasks of the Evaluation Facility** | **Tasks of the Certification Body** |
|---|---|
| At the time of application, the Evaluation Facility lists all qualified evaluators for each area of application and presents their technical qualifications. | The Certification Body examines the information and evidence submitted.
| | The audit team determines the group of evaluators to be interviewed. |
| The Evaluation Facility ensures that the personnel selected by the Certification Body is available to be interviewed during the system audit. | A member of the audit team conducts interviews with the selected personnel. |
| In addition, the evaluation body ensures that the technical equipment required for testing can be inspected and assessed on site (area of application: Component Certification). | The test equipment and its handling is assessed (area of application: Component Certification).|
| The Evaluation Facility fulfills the requirements for the security of facility and documents the respective regulations, specifications and processes. The evidence and documentation is to be submitted to the Certification Body at the time of application. | The Certification Body examines the provided documents.|
| The Evaluation Facility ensures that the technical supervisors on site can be questioned on the date of the audit and that the team of auditors are able to assess the premises of the Evaluation Facility, including all relevant rooms as defined by the Evaluation Facility within the scope of the audit. | The team of auditors examines the measures and processes on site, interviews the technical experts, inspects the premises of the Evaluation Facility as well as the rooms and equipment relevant for the security of the facility.|
| | All findings are presented and discussed at the end of the audit.|
| | The results of the audit are documented in a written audit report that may identify necessary corrective measures as discussed and must not be changed after written handover.|

### Phases of the Approval Process
The approval process for Evaluation Facilities is divided into the following three phases.

#### Preparatory Phase
Before submitting an application, an inquiry meeting with the IDS Certification Body is possible.
The purpose of this meeting is to provide the Applicant with an insight into the process, to select the area(s) of application and to discuss, among others, the topics of independence of the facility and application costs.

A template for the application is made available on the IDSA website. Applications will be processed in the order in which they are received.

On the basis of the documents submitted, an initial system analysis is carried out to determine whether the evidence submitted is sufficient to carry out the audit.
In this document check, a comparison with the requirements relevant for the area(s) of application takes place.
In the event of non-conformities, the Applicant will be given the opportunity to rectify them.

After a positive review of the documents, time schedules for the audit will be agreed in writing between Applicant and Certification Body.
In preparation, the Applicant receives an audit plan.
All participants in the procedure are obliged to inform the other participants of any deviations from the agreed time schedule.

After an application has been processed with a negative result, the application is rejected by the Certification Body.

### Audit Phase
During the audit phase, the Certification Body carries out an assessment consisting of the following parts:

- assessment of the quality management system,
- assessment of the information security management system and
- assessment of the competence of the evaluators per area of
 application.

The assessment is carried out to verify that the measures taken to meet the requirements are implemented and effective.

After collecting the evidence through interviews with the employees, inspection of records and documents as well as other measures (e.g. inspection of technical systems), the audit findings (deviations and potential for improvement) are made.
The Applicant will be informed of these and the result of the audit in a final discussion.

If deviations are found, a common understanding must be developed in the final discussion.
The coordination and scheduling of corrective measures takes place in the final discussion or, if necessary, after a root cause analysis has been carried out.

The result of the audit is summarized with a recommendation in an audit report.

All deviations that call into question the effectiveness of the management system must be corrected before a positive audit conclusion.
If necessary, the correction of the deviations can be verified by an additional audit.

#### Approval Phase
On the basis of the audit report, the Certification Body decides on the approval of the Applicant.
The decision is made in an objective and comprehensible manner, i.e. exclusively on the basis of the documented criteria.

The Certification Body issues an approval statement after a positive decision has been made.
The approval is limited in time; the limitation period is two years.

A negative approval decision is made if no professional competence for the area(s) of application or no effective quality management system or information security management system could be demonstrated.
In this case, the Applicant is informed of the reasons for the rejection before the application is formally rejected.

The Applicant is given the opportunity to comment and apply corrective measures within a reasonable period of time according to the deviation.
For critical deviations the maximum period is 2 months or longer in case of justified exceptions.
Uncritical findings will have to be corrected until the re-approval audit at the latest.

Within one month after notification of the decision, objections may be raised in writing.
The Applicant may waive the objection period in order to enable the approval to be published more quickly.

#### Renewal of Approval (Re-Approval)
Five months before the expiry of the approval, a request for re-approval is to be submitted in order to ensure that the approval continues without interruption.

An assessment by means of a trial evaluation does not take place in the case of re-approval, if the Evaluation Facility has carried out at least one evaluation per area of application.
During a renewal audit, the focus will be on the changes since the last audit.

#### Ad Hoc Approval
The assessment for an Ad Hoc Approval is necessary, when significant changes of the Evaluation Facility or of the IDS Certification standards occur, which could have an impact on the given approval.
The scenario for the Evaluation Facility includes e.g. changes regarding processes, persons, responsibilities, location or physical environment like laboratories.
The scenario for the IDS Certification standards includes major changes to the requirements catalogs or the certification procedure.

Unlike the (Re-)Approval, the Ad Hoc Approval mainly consists of the check of documents prefilled by the Evaluation Facility which explain the significance of the changes and whether they affect the ability of the Evaluation Facility to conduct evaluations.
The review of the documents is conducted by the Certification Body.

Based on these documents, the Certification Body decides, if a more detailed audit is necessary because the validity of the approval is at risk.
In this case, the next re-approval would be moved forward.

## Restriction, Suspension or Withdrawal of Approval
- The Evaluation Facility is obliged to inform the Certification Body in detail without delay if it becomes aware that the requirements for an Evaluation Facility have not been or are no longer met.
- If the Certification Body has reason to believe, that the requirements for an Evaluation Facility have not been or are no longer met, it shall immediately take the necessary measures to determine whether the requirements are met.
The action for determination should be an Ad Hoc Approval Assessment to analyze the potential non-fulfillment of requirements.
Based on this assessment, the re-approval Assessment may be moved forward to allow a more thorough assessment, if the validity of the approval is at risk.
The Certification Body may suspend the approval for the duration of the necessary assessment.
In the case of suspension, possible Applicants shall be informed of the suspension.
- The approval shall be withdrawn if the Evaluation Facility has not met or does no longer meet the requirements for Evaluation Facilities.
This might either be the case if necessary prerequisites for the approval are not or no longer met or if the Evaluation Facility does not conduct the evaluations according to the specifications, e.g. by not following the required procedures or by lacking quality in the evaluation.
- Evaluation reports by the affected Evaluation Facilities and certificates based on these reports facility should be (re-)assessed by the Certification Body to determine whether revocation, limitation or suspension of the certificate is necessary.
- The permission for an Evaluation Facility to conduct evaluations is restricted during the approval phases in the following way.
Before and during the process for the First Approval, no evaluation must be started or conducted.
Before the process for the re-approval, no restriction on the permission to evaluate applies.
During the process for a re-approval, evaluations can be conducted but it must be planned to finish the evaluations before the end of the current approval phase of two years.
Before and during the process for the Ad Hoc Approval, no restriction on the permission to evaluate applies.

### Competence Assessment
An International Data Spaces evaluation requires a certain level of expertise and specific qualifications from the evaluators.
In order to guarantee a high level of quality in the procedures, the evaluators employed by the Evaluation Facilities shall meet minimum technical and personal requirements.

The complexity and diversity of IT products and operational environments requires a high level of technical and product/system knowledge and of the relevant standards from the Evaluation Facility and the persons employed there for the evaluations.
These framework conditions make it necessary to formulate minimum requirements for the evaluators of the facilities seeking approval.

The requirements outlines in the following two sections shall already be met when presenting new evaluators to the Certification Body.

### Technical Requirements
- Proof of at least 3 relevant references from the last 3 years
- Basic knowledge of IT security
- Knowledge of the English languages
- Basic knowledge of project management
- Knowledge of the IDS Certification process

In addition, the evaluators shall meet the following minimum requirements for the area of application Component Certification:
- Knowledge of site security, network security and security management (e.g. ISO 27001 or IT- Grundschutz),
- Tool knowledge (especially development tools, analysis and attack tools),
- Experience in vulnerability analysis and penetration testing and
- Basic knowledge of cryptography (from test depth Concept Review).

For the area of application Operational Environment Certification, additional requirements are:
- Experience performing assessments according to ISO 27001, IT-Grundschutz or comparable standards.

### Personal Requirements
- Analytical approach to projects
- Reliable
- Ability to deal with conflict
- Ability to work in a team

## Framework Conditions for the Approval Process
The Applicant may withdraw the application for approval at any time during the process.
In this case, the process will be terminated from the Certification Body.
The costs and expenses incurred up to that point shall be charged by the Certification Body in accordance with the price list of the Certification Body.<Footnote 4>

The Certification Body may reject an application if the above requirements are not met or if an incomplete application for initial or re-approval is not completed within 3 months.

In order to maintain approval, the Evaluation Facility shall comply with the following requirements:
- The Evaluation Facility shall authorize and provide adequate support for periodic or ad hoc reviews to maintain approval.
The costs shall be paid by the Applicant.
- The Evaluation Facility shall immediately notify the Certification Body in writing of any change in its operating procedures with regard to compliance, its legal form, its ownership and participation, or its registered office(s).
The Evaluation Facility shall immediately notify the Certification Body in writing of any planned moves or relevant structural changes to the facilities premises.
- Amendments to the rules and regulations that are relevant for the approval and will require an Ad Hoc Approval will only be made by the IDSA once a year.
- As soon as an approved Evaluation Facility plans to move to new premises, the Certification Body must be informed of this intent.
A suitability audit of the new premises must be carried out before the Evaluation Facility moves.
- If an Evaluation Facility moves without the new premises being pre-audited, there shall be no approval of the Evaluation Facility in the new premises.
- New staff to be employed within the area of application shall be notified to the Certification Body before taking up evaluation activities.
- If an evaluator leaves the organization or is no longer active in IDS evaluations.
