# Component Certification

[todo: revise and describe the different levels <- move here from chapter 4.1 (Security)]  
[todo: add how non-connector components are addressed and that/how criteria are applicable for different deployment scenarios]

Core components to be used in the IDS must provide the required
functionality and level of security. The certification of core
components focuses on interoperability and security, while aiming to
strengthen the development and maintenance process of these components.

To build this trust in a structured way, the International Data Spaces
has established a well-defined process for core component certification.
An in-depth description of the certification process, and how it applies
to the key elements of the IDS architecture, can be found in Part 3 of
the White Paper Certification[^5]. The core component certification
criteria catalogue is available for free to all IDSA members.
