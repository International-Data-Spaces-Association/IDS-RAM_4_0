Figure [1](#fig:Certification_process){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Certification_process"} outlines the basic structure of
the certification process, together with the roles involved in this
process. The Certification Body and the Evaluation Facility belong to
the "Governance Body" category specified on the Business Layer (see
section 3.1.1). The tasks of these roles with regard to the
certification process are outlined in the following paragraphs. An
in-depth description of their responsibilities can be found in Part 1 of
the White Paper Certification[^2].

It should be noted that all roles described in this section are specific
to the International Data Spaces (i.e. terms such as "Certification
Body" should not be misunderstood to refer to an existing organization
already granting certificates).

The certification process is divided into the following three phases:

1.  Application Phase: The main goal of this stage is the successful
    start of the IDS evaluation and certification process.

2.  Evaluation Phase: The main goal of this stage is the evaluation of
    an applicant or core component based on the defined evaluation
    criteria.

3.  Certification Phase: The main goal of this stage is the examination
    of the evaluation report by the certification body, which issues a
    certificate if the result of the evaluation process is positive.

After a successfully completed evaluation process, the Certification
Body awards an International Data Spaces certificate to the applicant.
This certificate has a limited validity period. In order to renew a
certificate before it expires, re-certification is required, taking into
account any relevant external developments that have happened in the
meantime. Similarly, re-certification is required if changes are made to
the target of certification.

For authentication and authorization, each IDS component must have a
valid X.509 certificate. These technical certificates digitally
represent the evaluation certificate and enable automated trust checks
between partners prior to data transfer within the International Data
Spaces.

A more detailed description of the phases and the issuing of digital
certificates can be found in Part 1 and 4 of the White Paper
Certification[^3].
