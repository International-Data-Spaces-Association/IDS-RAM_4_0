# SECURITY PERSPECTIVE

[TODO: revise]

As stated in Section 1.1, one strategic requirement of the
International Data Spaces is to provide secure data supply
chains. This is critical for establishing and maintaining trust
among Participants that want to exchange and share data
and use Data Apps. The IDS Security Architecture provides
means to identify Participants,, protect communication and
data exchange transactions, and control the use of data after
it has been exchanged.
For these purposes, the International Data Spaces defines
a Trusted Connector as an extension of the Base Connector
(see Section 3.5). The IDS Connector ensures that the spec-
ifications and requirements of the Security Architecture ma-
terialize in everyday interactions and operations in the Inter-
national Data Spaces. The security aspects described in the
following constitute the basis of the IDS Connector. The dif-
ferences between a Trusted Connecter and a Base Connector
are detailed in the Security Profiles subsection 4.1.3.3.6.
