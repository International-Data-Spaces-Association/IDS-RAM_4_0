# Securing Applications

Building on a secure platform, all applications deployed on the connector need to integrate into the utilized security mechanisms and fulfill security requirements themselves.
In the following, we separately address the connector core services and control apps which typically have higher privileges and can be used to configure the platform, and the adapter and data apps which can be deployed on the connector to process data.

## Connector Core Services and Control Apps
The Connector Core Services (or respective Core Services for other IDS components) and Control Apps are responsible for offering IDS-specific interfaces, configuring the entire connector stack securely and managing data exchange and processing on the connector.
These applications often have higher privileges on the connector required to use and configure functionalities offered by the Kernel in the connector platform.
To reduce the attack surface, different functionalities should be split into modular and isolated applications interacting only via defined interfaces. The privileges for the applications should be reduced to those required for the respective functionality in accordance with the principle of least privilege.
It is important that the privileged applications are considered as a part of the overall security concept for the connector software stack applications in order to fulfill all security requirements for the IDS Component Certification. At least the following aspects should be addressed within the application (as well):
* Use of (external) interfaces shall be limited to a list of authorized users following the principle of least privilege.
* The applications need to check identification, authentication and authorization before allowing an user to interact with these external interfaces.
* Communication channels and sessions need to be secured following common best practices for ensuring integrity and confidentiality of communication. Securing the communication between connectors is further described in [Section 4.1.5](./4_1_5_Securing_Interaction_between_IDS_components.md).
* The Connector Core Services (and possibly control apps) need to support the negotiation and enforcement of (agreed) usage control policies. More details can be found in [Section 4.1.6](./4_1_6_Usage_Control.md)
* Configuration of the connector consists of configuring the connector core services and control apps themselves, and interacting with components in the platform responsible for configuring components in the kernel or runtime as well as for defining privileges and allowed communication routes between applications. While some aspects may be configured freely, security-critical configuration aspects (which were also assessed during certification) must be set to fixed values embedded in the utilized software images, limited to a pre-defined set of options or validated by certified code before coming into effect.
* Decisions or actions taken by the applications which are relevant for a latter re-construction of events and achieving non-repudiation, e.g., configuration changes or decisions on data access,  need to be logged. This can be achieved by a specific logging container or by integrating into the logging framework utilized by the platform. In both cases, the integrity of the audit logs needs to be ensured.
* For higher Trust Levels, the key material utilized for fulfilling the aforementioned requirements needs to be protected by hardware mechanisms and used through the respective kernel or runtime applications.

### Security measures for SW artefact types
#### Security measures performed by the platform
* Connector Core Services and Control Apps
  * Connector certification
  * Authenticity verification and integrity check
* Data Apps
  * App certification
    * Automated test suite
    * Optionally, manual verification
  * Authenticity verification and integrity check 
  * Access control for App interfaces, limitation to allowed data routes
   
#### Security measures performed by SW artefact
* Connector Core Services and Control Apps
  * Authentication and Authorization for external interfaces 
  * Provide protected external interfaces (to feed data into Data Apps)
* Data Apps  
  * Data Apps are protected by the Core Services or the platform.   


### Distribution of Apps via the App Store
* App License - similar to usage control policies for other types of data -> from developer
  * Pay once and use on own connectors -> no policy to be attached to app
  * Usage on a specific connector instance
  * Usage for a certain amount of time (e.g. usage on own connectors for a year)
  * Processing of amount x of data (number of packets, size of transferred data)
  * Free version of apps

### Adapter and Data Apps

![App Interactions](./media/app_interaction.png)

Securing the app in the connector:
* Container run-time responsible for ensuring the following aspects:
  * Integrity and authenticity of apps -> verified before start of app
  * Validation of license aspects (e.g. usage for time frame, ...)
* Routing responsible for controlling data flows between apps
  * Essential question: which data flows are allowed/how to decide which flows are allowed
  * First approach: data provider receives an overview of the data flows in the connector and what happens with their data in case of a transfer -> then they can decide whether they want to share or not
  * Open point: which interfaces do the apps require â†’ Suggestion:
    * store this data
    * give me this data
    * transfer this information to app X (on connector Y)
