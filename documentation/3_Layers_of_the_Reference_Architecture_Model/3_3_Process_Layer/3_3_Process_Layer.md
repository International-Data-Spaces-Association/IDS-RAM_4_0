# PROCESS LAYER

The Process Layer specifies the interactions taking place between the different components of the International Data Spaces. It thereby provides a dynamic view of the Reference Architecture Model.

In the following, three major processes and their sub processes are described:
1. **Onboarding**, i.e. what to do to be granted access to the International Data Spaces as a Data Provider or Data User.
2. **Data Offering**, i.e. searching for a suitable Data Provider.
3. **Usage Contract Negotiation**, i.e. accept data offers by negotiating the usage policies.
4. **Exchange Data**, i.e. transfer data between participants.
5. **Publishing and using Data Apps**, i.e. interacting with the IDS as an App Provider and user of a IDS Data Apps, respectively.

These three processes are related to the International Data Spaceâ€™s key value propositions and involve most of the roles introduced in the Business Layer section. The processes are illustrated using the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and sequence diagrams.
