## PUBLISHING AND USING DATA APPS
Data Apps can be used by Connectors for specific data processing or data transformation tasks. They can perform tasks of different complexity, ranging from simple data transformation to complex data analytics. An example of data transformation may be a Data App parsing a single string field with address information and producing a data structure consisting of street name and number, zip code, name of the city, and name of the country.

On a conceptual level, Data Apps can be treated the same way as data offerings in the International Data Spaces. Therefore, just as data is provided by a Data Provider using a Connector and registering this Connector at a Broker, Data Apps are created by an App Provider and registered at an App Store (using the App Provider's Connector as a means to communicate with the App Store). As a consequence, App Providers also need to undergo the Onboarding process. However, instead of registering their Connector at a Broker, App Providers  register their Data Apps at an App Store.

In order to be published, certain Data Apps require certification from the Certification Body (see section 3.5.1) (see first step of the process shown in Figure 3.12). When it comes to using a Data App that is offered by an App Store, App Users (Data Provider or Data Consumer) need to execute a process that is very similar to the 'Exchange Data' process described above.

For each Data App that was successfully certified, the corresponding metadata is stored in the App Store for being retrieved by users (e.g., Data Consumers or Data Providers) via a search interface. Searching for a Data App is part of the 'Find App' sub process depicted in Figure **//TODO**. If a user finds a suitable Data App (i.e., matching in functionality and compatible with the user's Connector packaging format) in the App Store, the App can be requested. This is indicated in the 'Retrieve App' sub process, which is conceptually identical with the 'Invoke Data Operation' process outlined in section 3.3.2, which is why a detailed discussion is omitted here.
