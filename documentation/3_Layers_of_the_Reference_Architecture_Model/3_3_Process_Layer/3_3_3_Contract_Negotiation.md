# Contract Negotiation

While a Connector Self-Description basically contains descriptive information about the datasets available, also Usage Control information can be extracted from them. In a (semi-)automated negotiation process performed by the Usage Control frameworks of the participating Connectors, the Data Consumer and the Data Provider need to agree on a Data Usage Contract. If an agreement has been reached, this contract is instantiated and deployed inside both Connectors. The Usage Contract both parties agree upon may need to be persisted in an immutable way by both sides. After the Usage Contract has been established, the consuming Connector can be configured to deal with further data coming in from the Data Provider in the future as specified by the contract.

- Update from Julia required
- Integrate Clearing House workflow during Contract Negotation
