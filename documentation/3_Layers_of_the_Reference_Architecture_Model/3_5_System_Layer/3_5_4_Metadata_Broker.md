# Metadata Broker

The IDS Metadata Broker consists of an IDS Connector (see section [3.5.2.0](./3_5_2_0_Connector.md)<!--//**TODO** add correct link-->), an endpoint for the registration, publication,
maintenance, and query of Self-Descriptions. Therefore, for any interaction with the IDS Metadata Broker the processes defined on the Process Layer, the descriptions defined on the Information Layer, and descriptions defined on the System Layer can be applied. The Information Layer describes the message types for registration and query. An IDS Metadata Broker may provide additional services that in term must be described by using terms from the IDS Information Model in the respective Metadata Broker's Self-Description document.
