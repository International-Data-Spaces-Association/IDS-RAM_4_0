# Identity Provider

## Dynamic Attribute Provisioning Service (DAPS)

## Participant Information Service (ParIS)

The [ParIS](./3_5_1_2_ParIS.md) is a vital part of the Identity Provider. While the CA is responsible to issue and manage technical identity proofs and the DAPS provides time-dependent tokens, the ParIS provides business-related  information of IDS Participants in machine- and human-readable manners.
