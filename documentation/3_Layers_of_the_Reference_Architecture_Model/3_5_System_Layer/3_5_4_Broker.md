# Broker

The IDS Broker consists of an IDS Connector (see section 3.5.2), a service for data source registration, publication,
maintenance, and query, based on an index. Therefore, for any interaction with the IDS Broker the processes defined on the Process Layer, the descriptions defined on the Information Layer, and descriptions defined on the System Layer can be applied. The Information Layer describes the messagetypes for Broker registration and query. An IDS Broker may provide additional services that must be described by the IDS Information Model.
