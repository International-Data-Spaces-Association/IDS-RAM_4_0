# Data Apps and App Store

An IDS Data App is an independent, functional, and re-usable software asset that is deployable, executable, and manageable on an IDS Connector.

As described in Section 3.5.1 IDS Connectors can make use of IDS Data Apps for several purposes. Three types of IDS Data Apps can be distinguished, namely Data App, Adapter App, and Control App, each performing different tasks in the IDS ecosystem. Applications of these types can be downloaded and fully managed by the IDS Connector:
* Data App: Applications of type Data App are re-usable, interchangeable, and connector-independent and perform small processing tasks, e.g., transform, clean, or analyse data. In other words, applications of this type manipulate the data available in some way. To define a data flow, the inputs and outputs of the components involved (Data App and IDS Connector) as well as of the backend system must be joined together. To summarize multiple processing steps on the same data, Data Apps can be chained together on the same data route.
* Adapter App: Applications of type Adapter App are re-usable, interchangeable, and connector-independent and provide access to enterprise information systems and making them available to the underlying Connector. As the Data App type, the data flow of Adapter Apps is defined by joining together matching inputs and outputs of the components involved (Adapter App, IDS Connector, and data sink/source or external service). Accordingly, Adapter Apps are used especially when the routing framework is not inherently capable of supporting the endpoints or protocols provided by external services.
* Control App: Applications of type Control App allow to control the Connector from external systems and is used to connect backend systems, which may consist of a single or a cluster of applications and services, to an IDS ecoystem. Therefore, in contrast to the types introduced before, the Control App works on the administrative control flow and is connector-specific as it requires programming against the respective API of a Connector in a specific version for its implementation. 

Furthermore, the different app types can be bundled, which allows building a data processing chain with several apps from all types chained together.

The IDS App Store is a secure platform for distributing Data Apps. It contains information about Data Apps available and their metadata; features different search options (e.g. by functional or
non-functional properties, pricing model, certification status, or community ratings). An IDS App Store consists of a registry for available Data Apps in this App Store. Therefore an App Store supports operations for Data App registration, publication, maintenance, and query, as well as operations for the provisioning of a Data App to a connector. These basic operations can be complemented by additional services, e.g. billing or support activities.

The basic App Store architecture is shown in Figure 3.5.3.1. In addition to the App Store Application (which manages metadata of apps) and the Connector, the Registry and Container Management components are part of the architecture as well and, as a consequence, part of processes to manage data apps. The Registry can be considered as a component of the App Store, as the container images of Data Apps are uploaded to the Registry. The Registry supports pulling and pushing of app images by Connectors. 
The Container Management component depicted in Figure 3.5.3.1 is more related to the Connector, as it bundles the Data App with its dependencies to simplify the deployment and maintenance of apps.
