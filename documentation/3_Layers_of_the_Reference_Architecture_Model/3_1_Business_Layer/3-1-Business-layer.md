## Business Layer {#subsec:business_layer}

The Business Layer of the Reference Architecture Model defines and
categorizes the different roles the participants in the International
Data Spaces may assume. Furthermore, it specifies basic patterns of
interaction taking place between these roles. It thereby contributes to
the development of innovative business models and digital, data-driven
services to be used by the participants in the International Data
Spaces.

While the Business Layer provides an abstract description of the roles
in the International Data Spaces, it can be considered a blueprint for
the other, more technical layers. The Business Layer can therefore be
used to verify the technical architecture of the International Data
Spaces. In this sense, the Business Layer specifies the requirements to
be addressed by the Functional Layer (see section
[0.2](#sec_functional_layer){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec_functional_layer"}).
