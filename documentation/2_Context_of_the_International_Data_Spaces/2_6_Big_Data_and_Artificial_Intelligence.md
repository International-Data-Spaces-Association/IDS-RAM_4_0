## Big Data and Artificial Intelligence ##

Today companies make a wide use of Big Data applications. The common use
case is to complement data available within the company by additional
data (e.g. open data, data from other companies or data from data
marketplaces). With the data portfolio extended this way, companies can
benefit from significantly improved analytics results or from entirely
new usage scenarios.

Alongside with Big Data applications, also Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications have become more and more mature and powerful. Companies
are increasingly using AI, which has led, and will continue to lead, to
an even greater demand for external data (e.g. for training of AI
models). However, companies often do not have sufficient data available
in-house, which is why the need for data sharing with regard to using AI
will rise.

A standardized architecture for data exchange and data sharing would
support the development and acceptance of both Big Data and AI
applications in industry. At the same time, it is necessary to define
usage policies for data sharing and retaining data sovereignty for data
providers.
