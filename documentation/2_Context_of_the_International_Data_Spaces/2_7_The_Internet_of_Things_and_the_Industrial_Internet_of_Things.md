## The Internet of Things and the Industrial Internet of Things {#subsec:iiot}

The Internet of Things (IoT) and the Industrial Internet of Things
(IIoT), respectively, comprises an ever-growing number of devices
generating more and more data. While there is mostly a clear focus on
the primary use of that data, it may be of interest for additional
stakeholders as well. This requires standardization with regard to the
(I)IoT architecture, but also standardization regarding data exchange
and data sharing -- in order to enable the data economy and facilitate
the establishment of data marketplaces. The wide use of data generated
within the (I)IoT will lead to new, smart and data centric services in
conjunction with new business models.
