# Privacy in the connected world

## Digital Services and Markets

The efficient markets hypothesis states that the market finds the correct price based on available information.
Financial Markets only work when information is freely available for all or gathered under the same rules. However, 
we have to face the fact that information in the internet is not equally available or distributed  in the ecosystem. Personal information is
gathered by multiple means, correlated within huge databases and analyzed with the available big data algorithms. 
On the upside this information gathering allows to analyze and human behavior for a social benefit. On the other side 
this data can be exploited by entities to gain an advantage over competitors in the market, and most importantly, 
by combining several sources, behavior can be traced back or attributed to a single person. 

The [digital markets act](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/56086/st08722-xx22.pdf) thus looks out to enforce privacy 
by so called „soft“ privacy means, which is based on compliance, consent, controls and audits. If a user has given 
consent to a certain type of data processing, companies make sure that their service offering complies with 
the the official regulations. Service provider are seen as „trusted“ entities.

Personal data is characterized by asymmetric interest. For each single person it’s own data is very important and
valued high. For companies a single dataset is rather uninteresting, but rather Metadata is available and can be gathered 
from many sources. Looking at it from a different angle: (Protocol-) Metadata can be used in various ways to combine data
sources and to draw conclusions, and it is the most underestimated privacy risk that currently exists in reality.
It remains thus doubtful if a single entity would be willing to sell it’s data to companies, as the expected price will not be paid. 
For economic reasons there will always be an over-supply of personal data, and thus the price of each single data set can 
be expected to be very low. Individuals will thus not be able to „sell“ their data, except when special circumstance are in place
(e.g. VIP persons need additional protection). Unfortunately, for this kind of special data, it is in consequence highly desirable 
to apply stronger protective means.

For these cases so called „hard“ privacy means need to be enforced, which go beyond the standard [GDPR](#) regulations. These
technologies do not establish „trusted“ entities, instead data is protected by reducing and minimizing data and trusted parties,
possibly working in/on encrypted data and platforms.

## The problem of collusion

The underlying problem of many data sources emanates from the fact that the collection and correlation of data allows
companies to draw conclusions even if each data record has been pseudonymized. The effect is called collusion and exists
also as an cybersecurity threat: over time multiple sources or access rights are collected, which in the end may lead to more
knowledge than required, also known as "access creep". 

Even for companies the problem of meta-data and collusion exists: In common B2B scenarios transactions are covered by 
contractual work and terms of service. However, as companies grow, they also become attractive for a take over of e.g. 
competitors. Although the primary business objective could still be covered by the contract, the now available metadata 
could be an attractive source of information. In addition, the terms of service could be changed on the longer term. How 
fast can companies switch their technology to an alternative provider, e.g. if an supplier has been bought by an competitor? 
Hence in addition we can identify the need data portability and of course for common rules and guidelines as they are defined 
by the IDSA. Although this example may sound artificially constructed, companies to have the obligation to protect the personal 
data of their customers. 

In addition companies not only have to protect the data of their customers. Also the data of their employees need protection 
for two reasons: 
First of all being able to track employees and their activities at each step during a process can be seen as a mode of
surveillance. Although an enterprise needs to know how well it’s processes are running to improve over time, it should not be
possible to attribute it to a single person, but rather on groups. E.g. during the preparation/execution of a phishing simulation, 
it must be ensured that the results conform to the privacy regulations of the EU. At least in Germany the workforce is organized by
intra-company work council, which has to be involved whenever data is collected and possible surveillance scenarios emerge.

Secondly, protecting the privacy of the workforce also protects the customers. As an example: a military camp has been discovered
in the internet only because the location of fitness trackers of the employees have been mapped to a card [reference required](#). The regular updates
showed the running path in the midst of a forest, where usually no such activities would take place. In addition in cybersecurity 
settings operators of service providers usually have access to the data of the customer. Protecting the privacy of the workforce 
minimizes the impact of potential fraud or blackmailing. Furthermore good security practices like four-eye principle and separation 
of duties ensure that data or money loss can be avoided.
