## Data as an Economic Good ##

It is indisputable that data has a value, and that data management
generates costs. Today, data is traded in the market like a commodity;
it has a price, and many companies monitor the costs incurred for data
management. However, data, being an intangible good, differs from
tangible goods with regard to a number of properties, among which the
fact that data is non-rival is considered the most important one. The
value of data increases as it is being used (and, in many cases, as the
number of user increases). While these differences hinder the adoption
and application of legal provisions to the management and use of data,
they do not dispute the fact that data is an economic good.

Depending on what type data is of, or what category it can be subsumed
under, the value it contributes to the development of innovative
products and services can vary. Therefore, the need for protection of
data is not the same across all data types and data categories. Public
data, for example, which can be accessed by anyone, requires a lower
level of protection than private data or club data.

Because of these differences and distinctions made with regard to data,
a generally accepted understanding of the value of data has not been
established so far. Nevertheless, there is a growing need to determine
the value of data, given the rapid developments taking place Data-driven 
Business Ecosystems.
