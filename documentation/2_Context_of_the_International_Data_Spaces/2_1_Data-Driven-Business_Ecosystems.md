## Data-Driven Business Ecosystems #

Novel digital products and services often emerge in business ecosystems,
which organizations enter to jointly fulfill the needs of customers
better than they can do on their own. In such ecosystems, which emerge
and dissolve much faster than traditional value creating networks, the
partners have a clear focus on end-to-end customer processes in order to
jointly develop innovative products and services. Actors in such
ecosystems can be businesses (also direct competitors), research
organizations, intermediaries (electronic marketplaces, for example),
governmental agencies, and customers.

Ecosystems are characterized by the fact that no member is capable of
creating innovation on its own. Instead, the ecosystem as a whole needs
to team up. In other words: Every member has to contribute something for
the benefit of all. Ideally, ecosystems function in an equilibrium state
of mutual benefits for all members.

A data-driven business ecosystem is an ecosystem in which data is the
strategic resource used by the members to jointly create innovative
value offerings. Key to success is to share and jointly maintain data
within such an ecosystem, as end-to-end customer process support can
only be achieved if the partners team up and jointly utilize their data
resource (as shown by a number of examples in the Figure below).
