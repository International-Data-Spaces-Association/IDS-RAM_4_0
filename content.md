## 4	Perspectives of the Reference Architecture Model	

### 4.1	Security Perspective	

4.1.1	Security Aspects on the Different Architectural Layers	

4.1.2	General Security Principles	

4.1.3	Key Security Concepts

 4.1.3.1 Secure Communication

  4.1.3.2 Identity Management
  
  > General outline:
  > Need for mapping between operational environment/component certification to identies (relation to Conformity assessment and IDS Certification)
  > requirements for identities including 2 options centralized (PKI) vs decentralized (DID)
  > describing on different levels: Organizations, Connectors /Execution environments and individuals
  > and
  > claim management, including 2 options DAPS and Verifiable Credentials
  > and
  > need for interoperability between the approaches

    Mapping of Participant Certification and Connector Certification to Identity Management
 
    Proposed PKI Structure
  
    Connector Certificate Deployment
  
     Using the Dynamic Attribute Provisioning Service (DAPS) for Identity Management
  
    Using an Authorization Service for Resource Access Control
  
     Trust Management
    
    PKI Rollout
    
    Identity Provider
    
    Software Provider
    
    Connector
    
    App Store
    
    App Provider
    
    Certification Body
    
    Connector Manifestations
    
    Configuration
    
    CA Certificates

### 4.3	Governance Perspective	

4.3.1 NEW: Governance for Data Space Instances (Federations) and Federation of Data Spaces (Federation of Federations)
	> Links to implications that arise out of this in the different sections/layers/perspectives should be added here

NEW 4.3.1 IDS Governance aspects of the IDSA Rule Book

4.3.1	Data Governance Aspects	
  
  Key roles and Correlating Data Governance and Management Activities
  
  IDS Data Governance Model

4.3.2	Data as an Economic Good


4.3.3	Data Ownership


4.3.4	Data Sovereignty	

4.3.5	Data Quality	

4.3.6	Data Provenance	

4.3.7 NEW: Data Privacy
	> Is this really and only a Governance aspect, it also has security concerns? 
	> let's outline the need from a governance aspect and then show the implications to the technical sections 
	> before including the security perspective. Add it also in the context to make clear what ids covers and what not. 
	>
	> maybe this should be part of data sovereignty or data ownership?
