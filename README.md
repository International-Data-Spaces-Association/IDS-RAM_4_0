# IDS RAM 4.0 (Public preview)

Welcome to the IDS RAM 4.0 repository of the [IDSA](../../../idsa). This repository is the working 
version of the IDS RAM 4.0. It was initialized with [IDS RAM 3.0](https://internationaldataspaces.org/download/16630/).

Most relevant content is already added to this repository, but some aspects are still in progress. You can today:
- Read the [current version in Markdown](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-RAM_4_0/tree/main/documentation)
- Raise an [issue](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-RAM_4_0/issues) on existing content or new content
- Check the open [pull requests](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-RAM_4_0/pulls)



_Please note that this is not yet the official and approved version of the IDS RAM 4.0._

and [pull requests](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-RAM_4_0/pulls).

The [IDS-G](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G) provides additional 
information to the IDS RAM.

## Schedule
The IDS RAM 4.0 should be released end of April 2022.

Regular touchpoints will be conducted starting from October 25th 2021:
- Mondays 4 pm to 4:30 pm (weekly)


## Scope

The IDS RAM is complemented with additional documents and repositories. Most relevant in this 
context is the IDS-G (including IDS-G-pre).
In general, the IDS RAM contains the conceptual level including technology-agnostic specifications.
The general outline of the IDS RAM is based on the five layers and the three perspectives. Each
layer should reflect the main components and aspects of the IDS.

The IDS-G contains specific details on specifications, e.g. APIs and their descriptions.

The IDS RAM 4.0 will be created as an online document and does not target a printed document, at first. 
This enables the use of linking contents more easily, e.g. creating references to the IDS-G. 
After that, a printable White Paper of the IDS RAM should be generated from this repository. 
There, the main outline of the concepts shall be described.

## Structure

The [content](./content.md) describes the target structure of the document.
The following list provides direct links to the existing chapters.
