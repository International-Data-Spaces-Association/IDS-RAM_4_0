[IDS-G](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G) provides additional information to the IDS-RAM.

## Schedule
The IDS-RAM 4.0 shall be released in April 2022. Therefore the development will be *freezed end of February 2022*.

Regular touchpoints will be conducted starting from October 25th 2021:
- Mondays 4 pm to 4:30 pm (weekly)
- Thursdays 8:30 am to 9 am (weekly)
- Wednesdays 10 am to 11 am (biweekly)

## Scope of IDS-RAM

The IDS-RAM is complemented with additional documents and repositories. Most relevant in this context is IDS-G (including IDS-G-pre).
In general, IDS-RAM contains the conceptual level including technology agnostic specifications.
The general outline of the IDS-RAM is based on the five layers and the three perspectives. Each
layer should reflect the main components and aspects of the IDS.

IDS-G contains specific details on specifications, e.g. APIs and their descriptions.

IDS-RAM 4.0 will be created as an online document and does not target a printed document first. This enables the use
of linking to content in other places more easily, e.g. IDS-G. A printable White Paper of the IDS-RAM should be generated
from this repository. Here the main outline of the concepts shall be described.


## Structure

The [content](./content.md) describes the target structure for the document.
